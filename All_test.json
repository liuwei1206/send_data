She and Ricardo Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.\n\nWe will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.\n\nYou should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost. Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify further opportunities for your engagement.\n\nI want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our efforts.

By its very nature, field reporting to Washington is candid and often incomplete information. It is not an expression of policy, nor does it always shape final policy decisions. Nevertheless, these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders, and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world, it can deeply impact not only US foreign policy interests, but those of our allies and friends around the world. To be clear -- such disclosures put at risk our diplomats, intelligence professionals, and people around the world who come to the United States for assistance in promoting democracy and open government. These documents also may include named individuals who in many cases live and work under oppressive regimes and who are trying to create more open and free societies. President Obama supports responsible, accountable, and open government at home and around the world, but this reckless and dangerous action runs counter to that goal. By releasing stolen and classified documents, Wikileaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals.

The receding waters will allow people to start the process of reconstruction more quickly. SEMAR and the Federal Police can provide air support as needed under the changed circumstances.\n\nSecond, President Calderon confirmed to his cabinet, and Secretary Espinosa confirmed it, that he was committed first and foremost to doing what is best for the population, and if that entailed the use of U.S. military helicopters, then he was ready to work with the United States to provide access to Mexican airspace.

Diplomacy and development are equal partners with defense in our smart power approach to promoting American interests and values abroad, our economic prosperity, and protecting our national security.\n\nThis new guidance is a critical element in our integrated approach to strengthening American leadership in a changing world. It enhances the capabilities and relationships we need to lead and meet our responsibilities for years to come. And it promotes our strategic priorities, including sustaining a global presence while strengthening our focus on the AsiaPacific region; deterring our adversaries and fulfilling our security commitments; investing in critical alliances and partnerships, including NATO; combating violent extremists and defending human dignity around the world; and preserving our ability to respond quickly to emerging threats. As we move forward with this strategy, we will continue to consult our allies and partners to address our shared concerns, seize new opportunities, and bolster global stability.\n\nI look forward to continuing the close partnership between the Departments of State and Defense as we work together to realize President Obama's vision for the security of the United States and its people."}

Both Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi control relevant parts of the State apparatus and Security Forces: Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi, acting as Muammar Gaddafi's de facto prime minister and exercising control over finances and logistics, and Abdullah Al-Senussi, acting as head of the Military Intelligence and exercising control over certain security organs.\"\n\nPut simply, the ICC demonstrates that Saif had control of the Security Apparatus and that the Security Apparatus perpetrated criminal acts.

Quilliam seeks to encourage a Western version of Islam, on the premise that there are more Muslims living in the Western world than the Middle East.\n\nSo far they have many focused on publications, reports, and media hits. Critics point out that while certain organizations, like Active Change, have positively engaged British Muslim communities, Quilliam has focused more on media efforts that spotlight the problem of extremism rather than actually countering it. They were, apparently, quite favored by the Labour Government of Gordon Brown, but have fallen out of favor, despite high hopes, with the Conservative Government.\n\nTwo of Quilliam's three founders, Maajid Nawaz and Rashad Zaman Ali, were at one point members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a long-standing pan-Islamic organization seeking to re-establish the Caliphate (but not a designated terrorist organization).

I consulted with USUN and AF to fact check this:\n\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has given the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) a very clear chapter 7 mandate. UNSC Resolution 1933 (June 2010) is the most recent confirmation of this. UNOCI's mandate includes the responsibility to \"protect civilians...within its capabilities and...in high risk areas of deployment,\" monitor the arms embargo, facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, and other responsibilities. Last week, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in which Nigeria is a driving force, released a communiqué that called on the UNSC to strengthen UNOCI's mandate. However, our view and the view of the UK and France is that the UNSC has already given UNOCI the strongest mandate possible. It's UNOCI's rules of engagement (ROE), which are drafted by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operates (DPKO), and not the Mission's UNSC mandate that should be strengthened and clarified. We're working in New York to push the DPKO to clarify UNOCI's ROE.\n\nAF and USUN's view is that UNOCI should do a better job in carrying out the civilian protection component of its mandate. USUN is working with the French to make this clear in the current UNSC resolution that is being negotiated in New York today, including inserting language that \"stresses [the UNSC's] full support given to UNOCI to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians.\" Nigeria, as a non-permanent member of the UNSC, is an active part of these discussions. To help enable UNOCI, we are working with other donors to train and equip new troop contributors to bring UNOCI's force level from its current deployment of approximately 9,000 soldiers to the mandated level of 11,150.\n\nMatt"}

The vote to invoke cloture will double as a vote on the motion to proceed, allowing senators to head home for Thanksgiving recess following the 8 p.m. vote.\n\nIf cloture is invoked, Reid would immediately call up his bill as a substitute amendment to a House measure that will serve as the shell for the motion to proceed vote. Senator Coburn had threatened to require the clerk to read the 2,000page bill following the vote on the motion to proceed, but Reid will call up the bill by number only, which prevents a reading.\n\nWhether Reid has the votes to break the filibuster Saturday hangs on three Democrats: Senators Lincoln, Landrieu, and Ben Nelson. All three say they are undecided, but appear to indicate they are leaning toward voting in favor of cloture.\n\nReportedly Landrieu has been using her leverage to attempt to change the bill as it moves forward and won a particularly sweet deal that could bring billions to Louisiana. Following 2005's Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana saw an increase in per capita income, which led to a significant drop in federal Medicaid funding. Reid included language in the bill that will increase funding by 50 percent of the total decrease.\n\nYou will recall that Senator Snowe was the only Republican to vote in favor of the Finance bill, but said she has too many concerns with Reid's version to support the cloture vote Saturday.\n\nEarlier this week, the CBO scored the Reid bill.

This also had long term deterrence value against regimes that would outsource the dirty work.\n\nTo now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white house or congress barely escaped destruction. Saddam Hussein wasn't connected to al Qaeda but the Taliban surely were without question.\n\nAnd Teheran and north Korea are watching carefully, gauging how much resolve the us has in stopping their plans. If the us lets the Taliban off the hook then they certainly can conclude it will do nothing beyond sanctions with them. And essentially letting karzai twist in the wind also suggests the us does not live up to it's commitments, giving pause to those who would help the us.\n\nPolitically, this is also quite dangerous.

If we got this \"gift\", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.\n\nHaving said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state."}

It was a busy week in the Turkish market, which started initially on a weaker note because of the disappointing inflation data released on Monday, but then recovered to follow other Eastern European markets and closed around 1.5 points higher on the week. The long awaited resignation of the Minister of Public Works added to the positive sentiment in the market. The Russian market rallied this week, first on the back of Latam stabilisation and then encouraged by the Moody's rating upgrade (see below). Prices peaked on Thursday, immediately after the upgrade, but failed to stay at those levels due to profit taking and a sliding Latam market, closing only one point higher than last Friday. Central and Eastern European investment grade assets remained stable throughout the week, which is a good sign given the sell-off in US Treasuries. Other countries in this region gained around  point, with Romania being the best performer gaining  point.\n\nOn Wednesday, Moody's raised the ratings of outstanding Eurobonds of the Russian Federation to B2 from B3 and changed the outlook for all hard currency instruments to \"positive\" from \"stable.\" Moody's noted that Russia's recent economic performance and tax reforms have generated twin surpluses (current account and budget) and large foreign currency reserves.

I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).\n\nSecond - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.\n\nThanks."}

This will prevent NERC from trying to splinter EPSA members on the EISB vs NERC issue,  and claim that Enron has endorsed NERC as the SSO. We need to make clear to NERC they are not the only sandbox we will be playing in to form an SSO.  We need to safeguard our ability to keep feet on both sides of the fence.\n\nThe strategy I have been pursuing for the past 6 months has been one of keeping competition out there for SSO status.  Our support of EISB has resulted in some good changes at NERC as seen last week.  Of course we are nowhere near finished.  We need to keep the competition going between NERC and EISB now more than ever since it is likely that without competition, NERC will spinmeister all its actions as broad-based consensus and sell that to FERC and the Hill.\n\nMy new focus is to maintain support for an EISB formation that is open and inclusive so that NERC will be challenged to demonstrate its reformation process (possibly through a Blue Ribbon Panel?) is as open and inclusive as EISB's.  EPSA plans to take up DOE's offer to sponsor a forum to form the 4th quadrant of EISB and we should participate in that forum.  If NERC cannot tout its process is as open and inclusive as any other, they will lose the fight."}

After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EPMI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (for example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim states that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the market, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Texas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the imbalance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies, since the load is already being served.)\n\nApparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/02 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market."}

It was first raised by AGA and a few LDCs (Brooklyn Union, in particular) in a rehearing request on one of the proceedings where a pipeline was filing compliance with Order 587 (the order requiring compliance with GISB).  GISB moved the issue into one of the committees, and the LDCs and a few marketers have been fighting over it ever since.  I understand that some pipelines side with the LDCs and some of them don't feel strongly about it one way or the other.  Ultimately, GISB reported to FERC that they weren't able to resolve the issue due to the conflicting viewpoints of the various segments.  Thus, the NOPR.\n\nInput from the traders is that they don't have objections to Partial Day Recalls as long as we know the capacity is released with that right reserved, so we can value our bids accordingly.  Leslie is going to write a short pleading to emphasize this position and point out that releasing shippers should be able to specify whether or not they intended to make the release subject to partial day recalls.  It shouldn't be a big deal, because they now have to specify whether or not they are subject to the current recall provisions.  It was not spelled out in the NOPR.\n\nWe will talk to Joe, but I've been told the Enron pipelines are not too concerned about it.\n\nBy the way, I had to join Brian Redmond for a conference call yesterday at 2:30, so I couldn't join the EPSA call.

Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).\n\nThe reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e. credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented. Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems. These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.\n\nThe ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight."}

This includes servers, computers, printers, etc.  We need some of the stuff on Schedule 18 such as the desks and chairs.  We are guaranteed use of this stuff so long as we stay in this building.

If you don't convey this equipment to us the only effect is that you will likely prevent us from moving as it will be too expensive!!!  An option to buy the equipment from the estate is essentially a worthless option.  The furiture will have little value to the estate and may be a liability as demand for that stuff in Portland is low and the cost to move is high (e.g., in Mexico shutting down the office cost $40k plus storage fees to move furniture into storage).  Furthermore, I have no reason to believe that an accounting firm working for the estate will give us a \"fair\" value on the furniture.  We don't want any furniture from the 4th floor that the estate will need.

Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-related CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that will return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the \"market\".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE\"s advice letter approaches, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some different PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they have a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (making it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollected while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surcharge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months."}

By normal standards, this air will not be all that cold, considering it is of Arctic origin. But, considering the time of year and how unseasonably warm it has been recently, this punch of Arctic air will bring an abrupt change for most of the week ahead.   A deep trough of low pressure, currently digging into the southwest U.S. will traverse the central states early this week, opening the gates behind to the air that is pooled in northern Canada. Beginning late Sunday or early Monday, the Arctic front will begin its plunge into the lower 48, reaching the Gulf Coast overnight Monday night.   The potential is for temperatures, across all the eastern half of the U.S., except Florida, to plummet as much as 30 degrees from Tuesday to Thursday, but the coldest nights could be later in the week as the skies clear.

I am extremely disappointed in many of the prevailing negative attitudes internally and particularly some of the terribly disrespectful questions and comments thrown at you in the meeting. You as always handled the situation with grace, humor and poise. You have tremendous support internally despite what I perceive to be a relatively spoiled group of people who have no concept how good we all have it despite our current issues. I have total faith in our management team and am happy to see a very proactive offensive underway. Thank you for your commitment to Enron and know that many of us long term employees know from experience we will beat these challenges. The daily communication updates are forthright and honest and help people better understand what is going on.\n\nI hope you can disengage and find some enjoyment this weekend!\n\nMichelle"}

I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.\n\nNow it's time to look forward.\n\nWith Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.\n\nOn Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.

PRESSURE.\n\nSeller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Arizona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PSIG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating pressure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point shall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement facility utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, and flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles Compressor station.\n\nIt is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine the required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 psig at the state line."}
{"id": 383, "domain": "Enron", "score": "3", "text": "Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's \"completed transactions\" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice."}

The problem FERC seems to have is that under the negotiated contract it is impossible for anyone but Columbia and the Shipper to know what the rate is at the time of the transaction.  Columbia's deal contains a default rate (based on index differentials) applicable if the parties are unable to agree on a basis price used to determine the \"Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge\".   To avoid the application of the default rate, the \"Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge\" requires Columbia and the shipper to negotiate, and agree,  to a basis number on a daily basis.  The parties did not specify particular index's for the purpose of calculating basis.  Thus, under Columbia's deal only the default rate can be determined at the time of the transaction.  In contrast, Transwestern's deals appear to be similar to Columbia's default rate; i.e., a rate based upon index's where the index's are agreed upon and stated upfront.  Thanks.  Greg"}

The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.

The spirits would mess with people's houses, so to appease the spirits, people would put food offerings out (trick-or-treat candy).  Also, they would try to scare the spirits away with frightening faces carved into gourds (jack-o-lanterns).\n\nWhen the Catholic Church came along, they altered the native pagan festival of Samhain into All Hallow's Eve (the Church did this with many pagan rituals--May Day and the May Pole, Easter--which comes from ancient love goddess Ashtaroth, whose symbols were the rabbit and the egg).  The reason the Church altered the pagan festivals to fit Christianity was to convert the pagans; they figured the best way to do so was to make it seem like the pagan's lives weren't really changing...just some of the names."}

In the case of multiple murders they should either pick the most violent one or choose a combination of elements from all and kill them that way instead of that sterile room with the sterile tubes and the sterile needle... or just tie them to a post out in the wilderness with a few superficial cuts on them and let the insects and animals have their way."}

Confucius had the idea that there was a fundamental \"good\" within all people and that government must appeal to the good and thus transform the people into ones who would feel the shame before committing an evil act, thus feeling the punishment prior to the misdeed.  Confucius had a much higher opinion of basic human nature than most Western theologians, it seems.

In modern society, liberals favour a liberal democracy with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed[2]. Liberalism rejected many foundational assumptions which dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, and established religion. Fundamental human rights that all liberals support include the right to life, liberty, and property. In many countries, \"modern\" liberalism differs from classical liberalism by asserting that government provision of some minimal level of material well-being takes priority over freedom from taxation. Liberalism has its roots in the Western Enlightenment, but the term now encompasses a diversity of political thought, with adherents spanning a large part of the political spectrum, from left to right. In the context of economics, the term \"liberalism\" refers to economic liberalism, which is associated with the political ideology of liberalism itself."}

Aristotle was seen as the infallible scientific mind, by proving him wrong, the church was wrong, and the church cannot be wrong.\n\nHe was important because he used modern technological methods to counter the arguments of the Church. It was one of the first times that the church was proven wrong from outside the grasp of Rome. It was a critical time, science had defeated the church."}

Your height is NOT too tall for a ballerina - Balanchine loved tall women for his ballerinas.  I've danced with several women that tall and taller.  If your are dancing with a male partner your IDEAL weight should be no more than 125 lbs and preferably 115 or less, unless your partner is built like a bull - what really matters is techique for lifts.  If you can jump and all your partner has to do is balance you - things will look great and it will be easy.  I've had 135 lb partners that seemed easy to lift like they had springs in their legs and I've danced with 110lb women that were poor jumpers and I literally had to lift off the floor.

Love is an experience, while God is not.  Since love is an experience, you can be certain of its existence (even if it is an illusion or mistaken) when you feel it, while an experience of the presence of god only is proof of the existence of that experience (because it can be illusionary or you can be mistaken about its source) not of God himself.\n\nYes, in the sense Nietzsche meant, God is dead today.  God has ceased to be a meaningful way to explain the world.  Even most devout christians look to science to explain the natural world today, which is why they try to claim that creationism is science.  Whether or not God actually exists is a different question.

Regardless, we came out with half a dozen donuts, which we were really eager to try - honestly, look at them, they looked like a million bucks.\n\nHowever, despite their looks, the donuts actually came off tasting pretty stale. The dough was dry, and wasn't as chewy as I thought they would be. It tasted like a really dry, dressed-up Tim Horton's donut that won the lottery. All the novelty in the world, with the moisture of a California drought. Which, sadly, wasn't what I was expecting. Out of all the donuts in our order, perhaps the Peanut Butter and Jelly donut was the one I most enjoyed - slightly moist, nutty, and flavourful. However, despite flavour, it didn't taste as fresh as I hoped it would be. Dry, with all the moisture and chewiness sucked out of it.\n\nOverall, I love the novelty and the creativity that goes into all the unique flavours, so if I'm ever in the area again, I'll give it another shot - perhaps earlier in the morning when they're fresher. Note that street parking in the area is limited, but if you check out the small side streets around the shop, you may get lucky and score some free parking."}

I would not choose to do an Asian cooking class as an individual based on my experience, but if you are looking to do a corporate event, I think Chop, Wok and Talk is a pretty good option. It's not authentic Asian which bothers me, as they are a cooking school. I wish they would caveat the menu with \"Asian inspired\" or \"Asian fusion\", since I found quite a few people had never had these dishes before (like Pho or papaya salad)... it's misleading. Nonetheless, authenticity aside, it's a pretty good, fresh way to do a work event.\n\nI've done the corporate team dinners twice now with Dorothy and her staff, at the Sigma conference center location. The dinner took about three hours and we were divided into teams, each tasked with preparing a different component of the meal. Dorothy can be quite authoritarian, but it's probably necessary given the timeline. Everything was well organized and the food, while not completely true to the flavors you would expect, was good.

I went with my BF around 1:30, the lunch rush seemed basically over, there were a good amount of people in there though. When we walked in it took about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and to get seated. It looked like the manager was standing around chatting with employees. Another 5+ minutes went by and a girl came and took our drink orders, a different girl brought us our drinks then she said she would get our server. 10 more minutes went by and I was wondering what was taking so long since they weren't very busy and she came over and asked us for our drink order, once she saw we had our drinks she took our food order an that was basically the last we saw of her. Yet another girl brought us our food and no one came over for re-fills or anything which was disappointing. Our \"waitress\" did come back to give us the check and ask how everything was. We didn't tip very much since we had like 5 different girls help us..or something like that.\n\nNow the good! The gyro was amazing, a great portion that I could barely finish. My BF got falafel that was also great. Loved the atmosphere and the \"feel\" of this place. I'll definitely go back and try to see if the service is any better. If the service wasn't so terrible this place would be a solid 4 stars! Worth a try for the yummy food...but still, so unimpressed with the professionalism here..or lack there of."}

They sold me a broken gun, and I understand that they didn't know it was broken, but just own up to selling me a broken gun and give me my money back. Not the case. They sent it out for \"repair\" and I didn't get the rifle back for 3 months. Ridiculous. I will NEVER buy another gun here again. Manager was rude and the gun clerk was just a salesman."}

As delicious as the chicken is, it has a premium price that doesn't match the product. When they first opened, the drums were almost twice the size of what they are now, making the price a little more reasonable. I suspect the reason for the change to smaller portions was due to the cooking time (twice-fried to give that signature crisp) being very long at first. This led to many earlier complaints, resulting in less repeat customers, the need to save money, the now odd hours/random closings, and shortages of some of the items on the menu (which they shouldn't have anyway), again all affecting repeat business.

The upside to this place is that its a bit cheaper than other chains like Odeon. Contrastingly the food is, as always, expensive. (Psst there's a newsagent across the road where you can buy cheap snacks!).\n\nFountain Park also contains predictable restaurants like Pizza Hut and Nandos, as well a Ten Pin Bowling and an arcade where I've been known to waste a few too many coins pretending to shoot aliens."}

The whiskey drinks where really good and a reasonable price. They also had small appetizers laid out. But unlike the advertisement said there was no food truck in sight. They also had the assemble bantam where for a small fee they had junk that you could nail, screw or tape together to make some peace of junk art. I make it sound bad but it was really fun to have a few drinks and with a crowed of people you have never met, slap some crap together to make a peace of art god forbid anyone would buy. But some how someone would. I say it's a fun and cheap thing to do on a Monday night so don't miss out."}

Our dog had a growth in her mouth which we became concerned and asked our neighbor for a vet recommendation and he highly suggested West Hill Animal Clinic. Though it is a bit of a drive we could not be happier with the clinic and our doctor, Dr. Greenway. Being a New Yorker I expect the best service and I sure received it at West Hill. The clinic is very clean, organized, secretaries are very well spoken and know your appointment before you even walk in through the door. Our dog had appointments before the surgery for blood work, which the Dr. followed up once the results were in, and when the surgery was performed our doctor sent us pictures of the surgery and the mass that was removed, which was followed by a phone call explaining every detail of the work done. After the surgery our Dr. called us to make sure that our dog was doing well. Every appointment with our doctor has been very informative and makes you trust that your dog is in good hands. Another reason why we are thrilled about this clinic is the cost of care. Again things in NY are very expensive when it comes to animal care and West Hill is very reasonable for the service you get.\n\nI will recommend this animal clinic to anyone who loves their pet as much as we do."}

The friendly staff helped me (the newbie) navigate though the many options on the menu. Got a large steak for my bf, it was HUGE and and small sweet chili chicken for myself (which was also huge).\n\nToppings had so much flavour, hot sauce is actually hot and they're definitely not stingy with the toppings. Will definitely be going back and I highly recommend.\n\nAlso, we used to live downtown and are used to going to the bigger burrito spots.... In my opinion, this spot has soooo much more flavour than the others!!"}

The crab insalata was some yummy dark greens dressed with a light viniagrette & plenty of yummy chunks of crabmeat.\n\nThe tomato sauce really was the best though...very bright, creamy with a slight smoky sweetness.

I customized it with barbecued pork ribs, pulled pork, barbecued beans, okra, waffle fries and a small side of coleslaw with rolls. My husband and I went to the Greenway Parkway location to pick it up. They wait until you arrive to cook the sides so they will be nice and hot. Our main course of ribs and pulled pork was in a warmer type oven until pick up. (I ordered and paid online to facilitate the process).\n\nThe service upon pick up was good, considering they were extremely busy for a Monday evening. Upon returning home, we unpacked everything and put some of it on our plates from each container. The meat was so good and flavorful. It was tender and melted in my mouth. We were so busy inhaling the food that we stopped our conversations and reveled in the awesomeness of the smoky, flavorful barbecue. It is some of the best thus far out here in Phoenix. Yes it is a chain, but with that said, it delivers on point and doesn't disappoint. I recommend this establishment if there is a hankering for good barbecue."}

I used to love going here, but I've noticed that the quality of the food has gone down.\n\nI ordered my usual turkey baguette, with a Thai tea and I was really turned off this time. I found an actual hair baked into the baguette. What's even more sad, is that I continued to eat the sandwich and tore off the piece of bread where the hair was because I was that hungry. (Ehh some people have it worse). The tea was not that great either, it it had a weird overly robust flavor, definitely not as good as it used to be.\n\nOverall, I probably won't come back to Lee's unless it's the one in Henderson since they seem to have better reviews."}

Most every burger aficionado inhabiting California and Nevada now knows what to expect from an In-N-Out Burger: not a fancy gourmet burger but a great-tasting burger nevertheless, with astoundingly fresh ingredients, including a generous slice of ripe red tomato, crunchy green lettuce, and either a lovely cold and thick slice of White Onion or warm grilled onion ribbons, together with a foundation of nice and creamy Thousand Island Dressing slathered over the base of a soft and supple hamburger bun.  Whether a Double-Double, a Cheeseburger, or a Hamburger, the model is pretty much the same, and each variety of burger is surely enhanced by an order of freshly cut skin-on French Fries.  Liberally add readily available tomato ketchup to both burger and fries, and a memorable dining experience will be close at hand.\n\nThat's the way it was the other night when I enjoyed the trifecta of Cheeseburger, Hamburger, and an open-faced paper tray filled with freshly made fries.\n\nSeats were hard.  But who cared?  Associates were very pleasant and accommodating.  My burgers were prepared close to medium rare as sought, and when ready, the food was even brought to our booth.  But inexplicably, although I tendered a ten dollar bill and a five dollar bill to pay the total of $13.78, the receipt received listed cash tendered as $14.97, and change returned as $1.19 instead of the correct amount of $1.22.\n\nExcept for the unnecessary loss of a few extra pennies, another fine In-N-Out dining experience!"}

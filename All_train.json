Progress on this issue would help us later as we address the even more difficult issue of the \"defamation of religions\" about which the Secretary expressed interest in a Monday senior staff meeting.\n\nAn 10-DRL-L-NEA group has been working together to implement the strategy that involves reaching agreement with the Egyptians on a text that we will roll out late next week with countries in the OIC (Organization of the Islamic Conference) and the WEOG (Western European and Other Group, our regional group at the UN).\n\nExperts in L, DRL, 10, and NEA agree that the text protects all USG red lines and offers us a workable compromise that can secure genuine cross-regional consensus when presented in the Human Rights Council in September, hopefully avoiding a divisive vote on this issue. US and Egyptian teams also agreed to the possibility of further cooperation in the UNGA to come to a soft landing on defamation of religions if Cairo and Washington first succeed in passing the FoE resolution by OIC/WEOG consensus."}

However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry attempts in the mountains around the Jimani crossing.\n\nc) A Haitian immigration official said that as of lpm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue being allowed in.\n\nd) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on the Haitian side began demanding \"manifests\" from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR officials managed to talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal.

When I met with a couple of the Afghan women who participated in the recent peace jirga, they told me that it would send a very strong message if a large group of women representing Afghan civil society could meet with you when you are in Kabul for the conference.

I would have hoped the stories would have focused on the work that I have done the past three years leading the Foreign Policy program at Brookings and directing a major international project on global governance that has called for bringing Mexico, Brazil, China, India and South Africa into new institutional arrangements for global governance. In the study we stress that none of the major transnational challenges of the day — from the economic crisis to climate change — can be solved without engaging the world's emerging economies, starting with Mexico, and giving them an equal seat at the table in an expanded G8.\n\nThe other key theme is the work I have done in bringing together \"government-wide\" initiatives to work in partnership with other countries. One cannot treat drugs, immigration, energy and international politics in separate cones. Rather, they affect each other, and our foreign policy needs to integrate these interconnected elements into a coherent strategy that produces results. The point is that we want to work with our international partners in ways that address their realties — and not let policy be derived from our bureaucratic structures.\n\nI understand that the situation with Mexico is complicated.

This policy brief, GAVI'S Future: Steps to Build Strategic Leadership, Financial Sustainability, and Better Partnerships, was developed collaboratively by the CSIS Global Health Policy Center and the Center for Global Development. The brief provides analysis and recommendations to GAVI leadership in three vital issue areas: GAVI's mandate and business model; its financing strategy; and the GAVI Secretariat and partners' capacities.\n\nIts many achievements notwithstanding, GAVI will need a strengthened, strategic approach to meet future demands. In the midst of a global recession and constrained donor and national budgets, and as the vaccine landscape expands and becomes more complex, GAVI will need to concentrate on its core mission, extend coverage to the underserved in low-income countries, plan strategically for the future, better tie health systems investments to vaccine gains, and test whether GAVI can contribute to assisting lower-middle-income countries accelerate their immunizations. It is essential that GAVI's financing efforts shape markets to reduce vaccine pricing, at the same time that GAVI aggressively leverages traditional donors, wins over emerging economies, and increases partner government commitments. The GAVI Secretariat can and should do more to maximize its partnerships with UNICEF, the World Bank, and WHO, and GAVI will benefit significantly from much stronger branding, communications, and high-level outreach and representation.\n\nClick here to read the full brief: http://smartglobalhealth.org/GAVI"}

Here's my quick take.-Andrew\n\nIslamist forces do not command nation-wide support and probably do not represent a direct political threat to the TNC, but their advanced battlefield experience and access to weaponry could pose a significant military challenge.\n\n• The Islamists are not particularly popular outside of certain areas of eastern Libya. Sallabi and his followers are as vilified as Jibril in much of the country. Indeed, many of the political groups that oppose Jibril, such as those centered in Misrata, view the Islamists with equal, if not, more hostility.\n\n• Both Islamist and secular militias have operated with relative restraint so far. With Sirte and Bani Walid still in regime hands and Qadhafi on the loose, there is enough of a rationale to support continued cooperation.\n\n• However, once operations against Qadhafi and the regime are wrapped up, this force for unity is likely to dissipate. It is at this point that militias, including the Islamists, will probably abandon caution and pursue a more aggressive campaign for power, perhaps including violence.\n\nEven though the Islamists may not be able to displace the INC. Jibril and his allies suffer from a serious credibility problem. If the INC fails to make strides in giving other political movements (in Tripoli, Misrata, Zintan, and elsewhere) a real role in governance, it may find itself without a viable national political base."}

Koh's problem is that when he associates himself with an administration policy that troubles his friends, we know about it, since of course he is free to agree publicly with his president (and since the administration is likely to roll him out as a spokesman on precisely those occasions). When he pushes to change or strengthen a policy in ways that champions of human rights would cheer, we are less likely to find out, because he has to be discreet in such efforts to remain effective. But whatever one thinks of his arguments about the War Powers Act and Libya, Koh has remained a dogged champion of many causes to which he has dedicated his life — from urging the administration to stick to its guns on closing Guantanamo, to advocating civilian trials for terror suspects, to elevating the promotion of human rights and justice for war crimes in American foreign policy.\n\nTom Malinowski Washington Director Human Rights Watch 1630 Connecticut Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20009\n\nTom Malinowski"}

Congress raised concerns over this in 2009 and appropriated funds for EPA to conduct a scientific study on possible chemical contamination of groundwater that might result from this process. The study is anticipated to be finalized in 2012.

There are two ways:\n\n1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about our effectiveness.\n\n2. The alternative would be for the administration to say: a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.\n\nb. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of housing units.

With Europe in crisis and anaemic growth at home, the US wants to tap into Asian markets to meet Mr Obama's target of doubling exports and creating jobs.\n\nAfter being distracted for a decade in the Middle East, Washington's \"pivot\" towards Asia — to use secretary of state Hillary Clinton's word — shows it has woken up to the region's rise. US re-engagement, in strategic as well as economic terms, is to be broadly welcomed. But there are challenges, even dangers. Washington will need finesse to get it right.\n\nIts main trade initiative is the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr Obama wants the nine negotiating countries plus Japan, if possible — to sign a \"next-generation\" trade agreement by the end of 2012. The TPP is supposed to incorporate non-tariff issues, such as government procurement and intellectual property protection. Getting Japan to sign up to a meaningful deal will be extremely difficult, given intense opposition from farmers.

Specifically, we have,\n\n(1) Increased the flow of high-level USG visitors to the EP. Recent visitors include Janet Napolitano, Dick Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dick Morningstar and Ron Kirk. These visits culminated last month in a highly successful address by VP Biden to a Plenary Session of the EP. I hope that you will also address a Plenary Session of the EP in the near term. (Your town hall meeting at the EP with young leaders last year was well-received here.)\n\n(2) Increased the flow and quality of EP interactions in Washington. We have facilitated a dramatic increase in the number of EP delegations visiting Washington and a significant improvement in the level of their access to high-level USG officials.\n\n(3) Increased USEU outreach to the EP at every level. At the Mission, we are restructuring the way in which we interact with EP leaders by institutionalizing responsibility for key relationships and enhancing accountability. In the coming months, we expect to receive two additional FTEs at the Mission to improve our ability to cover the EP.

Suppose we launched a \"Pledge for Palestine\" campaign that copies Warren Buffet's \"The Giving Pledge\" campaign, described below — he's trying to get 40 billionaires to give away most of their money. I had asked some S/P folks to think about how we might take that campaign global to help change the attitudes of elites in places like Pakistan and Latin America, but perhaps Warren Buffet could be convinced to lend his name — or perhaps Michael Bloomberg or Danny Abraham (together with a very wealthy Muslim) to a similar Pledge for Palestine campaign. Such a campaign among billionaires/multi-millionaires around the world would reflect a strong vote of confidence in the building of a Palestinian state and could offset the ending of the moratorium for Palestinians (there would also be a certain shaming effect re Israelis, who would be building settlements in the face of a pledge for peace). With even 30 calls to the right people in the Clinton fundraising network it should be possible to generate a substantial enough amount quickly enough to capture the public imagination on the heels of the President's speech and, critically, to serve as an expression of global solidarity with the Palestinians and but also a meaningful promise of material improvements for Palestinians on the West Bank. That could significantly bolster Abbas in a way that could help him stay in the talks. This is what diplomacy beyond the state should mean.\n\nA brief description of the Buffett campaign is below; a longer description with the people Buffett has approached is attached.\n\nAM"}

In fact, we first heard of the announcement through press reports.\n\n• Upon hearing the news, Ambassador Lomellin immediately raised concern with the Secretary General and expressed our displeasure, as he should have consulted with the USG before making this appointment. We specifically expressed concern that the Governor's views might be misconstrued as representing official U.S. policy, and in particular on the very sensitive issue of U.S.-Cuba policy. Insulza committed that it would not occur.\n\n• Gov. Richardson is a private citizen and his views in no way represent U.S. foreign policy.\n\n• We remain concerned with the implications of this designation in potentially misrepresenting the views of the , U.S. and the Organization of American States, and intend to raise the matter again with Insulza in light of Gov.

We had an interesting conversation on Iran and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands of political killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in reserve."}

In Khartoum, PAS contacted an IVLP alumnus and shared USG statements with him, leading him to convince the Muslim organization he is part of to call off a planned demonstration and to express support for the Secretary's statement. In Zanzibar, after the Embassy sent them a statement reiterating public comments by the White House and the Secretary and reiterating long-standing USG support for Tanzania, another Muslim group canceled its planned demonstration to show appreciation for the embassy's statement. The Somalia unit (based in Nairobi) received statements of support both from the new Somali government as well as Somali radio outlets, in response to Somali-language translations of S and POTUS statements.

While people have a right to work, I believe we get to review a contractor's management team and instruct them on who is acceptable or not, right? I don't necessarily buy into POGO's Nuremberg defense, that people are exonerated because they were forced to debase themselves. But I see the release below as good news, that we have established momentum on the issue. We should retain it even though it will become more challenging as Congress returns next week.\n\nPJ"}

Graham told K flatly no SPD without process solutions on detentions and night raids; if that's not what he can accept, Americans will not support and he can forget it. K was obstinate and offensive, if calm, blaming the conflict on the US and twice describing US as occupiers— right after saying he is committed to the partnership.

However, he also sees this situation as an opportunity for France to reassert itself as a military power. French military commanders were extremely disappointed when, what they believe to be, political differences between the United States and France prevented them from participating in the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every turn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk (the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed, Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and statebuilding budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants.

Glen Doherty was a fellow member of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation Advisory Board, which fights to ensure that our military is not further compromised by the Christian Dominionists who seek to turn it into an instrument of their religious zealotry, an army for Christ rather than for the defense of our nation.

I wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today's column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it will be close to or at the top of the media's attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican's have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem. All best, your friend, Jamie\n\nJames P. Rubin"}

The Forum is sponsored by the German Marshall Fund (Ron Asmus), and Ambassador Holbrooke has attended every year. His presence this year consists of two things: 1) bilat meetings including those with EU High Rep Catherine Ashton, Codel Casey, Nato Sec Gen Rasmussen, Ambassador Daalder, and Ambassador Kennard (some with Mullen); and 2) an internationally televised BBC discussion on Afghanistan and Pakistan with Admiral Mullen.

The thousands of Dutch men and women I have met from all walks of life who have welcomed me and supported my work have made me even prouder of that heritage.

I have strived to meet that standard, especially in the vital areas of equal rights and opportunity for women and girls and in protecting our environment. On both issues, the Dutch are our strong partners. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity I have had to be a part of the Obama administration on the Clinton team, working to improve our relationships all over the world.\n\nWith appreciation and a continuing commitment to the Obama Administration and your diplomatic efforts, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nFay Hartog Levin Ambassador"}

Economic statecraft has two parts: first, how we harness the tools and forces of global economics to strengthen our diplomacy; and second, how we are putting our diplomacy to work to strengthen our economy.\n\nUltimately, diplomacy and economics are a reinforcing cycle — our diplomacy can help spur economic growth at home (while of course recognizing that the work we have to do domestically, in infrastructure, entitlement reform, etc. is by far the most important thing), which in turn strengthens our economy, which in turn strengthens our diplomatic hand overseas in a world in which economic influence is a primary point of leverage and leadership, and so on."}

The nation's employers added 115,000 positions on net, after adding 154,000 in March. April's job growth was less than what economists had been predicting. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.1 percent in April, from 8.2 percent, partly because workers dropped out of the labor force.\n\nGovernment job losses totaling 15,000 continued to weigh on the economy, tugging down job growth as state and local governments grapple with strained budgets.

Venizelos, however, announced a new property tax levy (to be collected via electricity bills) in a desperate effort to raise more revenue. There is widespread backlash against this latest tax increase. Even those who have supported the government up until now believe that this is the wrong way to go and that the PASOK government is refusing to do what really needs to be done which is to slash public expenditures by eliminating positions or furloughing unneeded employees, and to get serious about collecting taxes from those who still do not pay.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we continue to hear more and more rumors of either early elections or some sort of \"grand coalition\" government. The problem is, of course, that early elections will not likely resolve anything. New Democracy leader Samaras has not changed his critical tone and continues to insist that somehow he would be in a better position to \"negotiate\" with the Troika. While New Democracy did join forces with the government last month in passing much-needed educational reform, they have not shown any inclination to help the government on much tougher measures to streamline the bureaucracy and trim public expenditures. In their defense, however, the ruling party itself remains intensely divided on this score, which is doubtless why the government keeps going back to the same well when it comes to short-term taxes or revenue \"fixes.\"\n\nWhat more can I say?

The possibility has raised a few eyebrows in town because Nuland, who's married to political scientist and Washington Post columnist Robert Kagan , was principal national security adviser to Dick Cheney starting right after the invasion of Iraq, from July 2003 to July 2005.

Another question is whether Nuland will be the traveling spokesperson when Clinton goes overseas.

Under this rule, the Fourth Amendment does not require reasonable suspicion that the detainee is hiding contraband, or that the detainee is alleged to have committed more than a minor offense, before prison or jail officials conduct such a search. The Department of Justice had filed an amicus brief supporting this result.\n\nAs noted by the Chief Justice and Justice Alito, the Court left open the possibility of exceptions, such as where the detainee is to be segregated from the general population. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, however, appears to rule out a test based on the seriousness of the offense. Justice Breyer, in his four-justice dissent, would have held that a strip search of an individual arrested for a minor offense that does not involve drugs or violence is \"unreasonable\" unless supported by reasonable suspicion.

I think that this probably stems from two factors:  (1) the bank, financial, more formalized risk training that the London staff has had, versus the energy company, more physical commodity oriented, on-the-fly, in-the-trenches type of indoctrination of the Houston team; and (2) the difference in the magnitude of the businesses and the degree of maturity of the Houston and London commodity markets (smaller business with a less rapid and volatile trading environment lends itself to a more reflective, studied approach and a larger, rapidly paced market place creates less time for study and more need for quick, practical solutions).  I think sometimes that the London risk team conveys a feeling of superiority over their Houston counterparts with regard to their risk analysis skill set, their \"theorectical\" approach.

While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it.  One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been \"approved\" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation.\n\nIf this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has \"approved\" PJM.  By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000.  They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the \"ISO principles\" of Order 888.\n\nYour thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs.  If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to \"freeze\" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law."}

Davis's interim communications director Steve Maviglio sold the 300 shares of Calpine that he had purchased last month, said Deputy Press Secretary Hilary McLean.  Republicans and public-interest groups criticized Maviglio for purchasing the stock while the Davis administration was negotiating long-term energy contracts with Calpine and promoting the company's efforts to build power plants in California.  ``He (Maviglio) felt it was becoming a distraction,'' McLean said.  Maviglio said that he had purchased 300 shares of Calpine at $40 each on June 20, after putting in an order on May 31. He denied any conflict of interest and said the stock was sold earlier this week.  Shares of San Jose, California-based Calpine rose 76 cents to $36.76 in midafternoon trading. They had dropped 9.7 percent from June 20 to yesterday's close.  Maviglio won't be fired or reprimanded for the purchase, McLean said. He won't comment on any conflict-of-interest issues before the administration, she said.  Republicans and public interest groups have criticized Davis after disclosures that some advisers and consultants to the state on energy matters owned shares in companies that are trading electricity or negotiating long-term power contracts with California.  California in January stepped in and began buying power for its two largest utilities, which are insolvent after running up more than $15 billion in debt because of a shortage of power plants and flaws in the state's deregulation law."}

However, what's changed since the last time you and I spoke about this project is that our friend Bill Wise has been talking with the Chairman of Pemex about doing a similar (180 mile) expansion of El Paso's system from Waha to Samalayuca.  His proposal was to provide incremental firm service to Pemex at EPNG's currently effective \"Texas\" rates (low 20 cent range).  Pemex management is willing to recommend to its Board of Directors going with a slightly higher rate on TransPecos in order to get the benefits of supply diversity and leverage, but the TransPecos rate needs to be as close to EPNG's as possible to make the case compelling.\n\nTherefore, what we're trying to accomplish here is to give Pemex a rate representing effectively a rate cap, with an \"upside\" that if the FERC rate is less than the cap (which it might well be), then Pemex gets the lower rate.  It's just going to be damned difficult to hit a McGwire home run here with El Paso breathing down our neck.  I truly believe this is the best we can negotiate for fear of Pemex going back to their comfort zone with EPNG.\n\nDan McCarty was with me in our last meeting in Mexico City and I think he was reading the tea leaves similarly."}

One can also take the interpretation that it was meant to apply only to the 3 cent and not to the 1 cent surcharge.  Obviously, SCE took the former interpretation and PG&E the latter.  That is one reason why we have been very careful about attacking this issue.   AReM has protested PG&E charging the one cent surcharge and supported Edison's approach in responding to the advice letters filed months ago.  AReM continues to work with the CPUC staff to get the staff to support AReM when it responds to the advice letters.

As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.

(In other words, if we were to do this, the material would have to state that Rob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the bipartisan support for the deregulation initiative and how such bipartisan support is good for the Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so would not alienate the governing Conservatives. (The Conservatives have always encouraged us to do what we can to keep the Liberals on side and I think they would be sophisticated enough to appreciate that efforts would involve participation in such fund raising events - particularly if the material used did not endorse the Liberals and merely recognized their support for moving forward).

These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term \"take away rights\", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a \"single bus\" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.\n\nEach participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.\n\nThe \"single bus\" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB."}

To date, NBC has resisted all of our commercial solutions to this issue.  At the close of business today, our cure period for the event of default will expire, and NBC will be able to draw on the $1.4MM LC posted and terminate the contract. Today we have seen a bit of movement in their position.  They are now willing to accept cash as collateral if Enron will agree to reduce its collateral threshold to some agreed upon amount.  Bill Bonnell, their credit manager, has suggested $4MM as the appropriate level. This would entail Enron posting $3MM in addition to the $500K collateral call for a total of $3.5MM.  I believe we could more than likely negotiate the threshold to $5MM if we are willing to post the cash.  A $5MM level would require an additional posting of $2MM which is what we originally forecasted to try to buy down the position exposure.

They indicated that JBP was interested in improving the assets (they are currently implementing a debottlenecking project at Cenibra) and then selling them for cash flow reasons.  The strongest possible buyer at this point would be VCP as they're currently in a very strong financial position (low leverage and are part of the Votorantim conglomerate which throws off considerable cash from its cement and financial services businessnes).  Also look for the Scandinavians to possibly make a bid for the assets as they've expressed interest in obtaining eucalyptus assets in the past.  We can most likely discount Aracruz from the running as they're currently rumored to be an acquisition target themselves (most likely buyer would again be VCP as they recently purchased Mondi's stake in the company and presently holds a 28% share in Aracruz --- however, it's doubtful that VCP would be able to swallow Cenibra and Aracruz simultaneously).  What does this mean for the market?  Any purchase by VCP would make them the strongest eucalyptus pulp producer globally with over 2 million tons (estimated market pulp would be about 1.7 million tons) and give them considerable pricing power as they would represent roughly 30% of global market capacity for eucalyptus pulp.\n\nPlease note that this is a rumor at this point and should be viewed as such.

Several years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clean energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller of clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean credits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generator was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount of credits).

The Contract Group processes the new (base) agreement and any POI/MDQ/TERM type changes.  All FTS service requests still go to Contracts and, after the Capacity/Credit issues are completed and the contract printed out, the entire contract folder is forwarded to Deal Capture for additional processing (all firm contracts/amendments get sent to Deal Capture for review).  Deal Capture gets with the Marketer to determine if a Discount is being offered and then creates the Discount Amendment, Routes it for approval (if needed) and Tenders all documents to the Shipper.  Deal Capture is responsible for obtaining all approvals other than Capacity and Credit.  When (if) the Agreement is executed and returned by the Shipper, Deal Capture will handoff the original documents back to Contracts for activation and to complete all additional distribution and processing.  Let me know if you have any concerns or questions.  As the first few deals go through, we'll need your feedback to see if the process needs some adjustments.  Thanks for all your help..."}

Even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and security knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  When you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill us with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work everything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your Christian walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities.\n\nWhen you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.

This structure allows for unlimited banking of allowances. However, if the amount of banked allowances in any year exceeds 10 percent of the total regional emissions cap, any emission withdrawals in the subsequent period in excess of 10 percent of the cap must be withdrawn on a two-for-one basis; two allowances must therefore be withdrawn to offset one ton of NOX emitted.\n\nImplementation of PFC is through a ratio which defines the percentage of each entity's bank available at 1:1. The ratio equals 10 percent of the next year's budget divided by the total bank. The ratio is applied evenly to all, regardless of whether their bank exceeds 10 percent of their own budget.\n\nProgressive flow control, if triggered, has a large impact because it discourages allowance banking due to the possibility that allowances will be de-rated by 50 percent. In addition, withdrawals are more costly if they occur at 2:1. As a result, PFC leads to more dramatic NOX price spikes and valleys."}

Second, Terry indicated that OneOk is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters are OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall.\n\nSpencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their position.

They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality.\n\nWilliams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.\n\nIf the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.

{"id": 1287, "domain": "Enron", "score": "3", "text": "I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself."}

I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankruptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afternoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of the expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can declare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination payment and if they don't pay draw.

The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.\n\nThe transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.

In several instances Mirant is also  not telling any of the downstream counter parties until after the hour of the cut.  This evening  Steve and I had four separate schedules in which Mirant was cut by PAC transmission for several hours.  In each of these cases Mirant was unwilling to re-supply and was unwilling to contact the downstream counter parties.  It appears to me that they don't want to take the time to re-supply or are simply not competent enough to fill the schedules.  On three of these schedules I had to negotiate a book out for Mirant and on one I was able to re-supply.  In all of the recent cuts I have dealt with them on they have acted in a similar manner.

Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.\n\nOn the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.

But with regard specifally to the risk management teams, my sense is that the London team tends to address things more from a theoretical, academic perspective (raising lots of questions and talking about what \"should be\") and that the Houston team tends to be more action-oriented in the here-and-now (thus my reference to practical).  I think that this probably stems from two factors:  (1) the bank, financial, more formalized risk training that the London staff has had, versus the energy company, more physical commodity oriented, on-the-fly, in-the-trenches type of indoctrination of the Houston team; and (2) the difference in the magnitude of the businesses and the degree of maturity of the Houston and London commodity markets (smaller business with a less rapid and volatile trading environment lends itself to a more reflective, studied approach and a larger, rapidly paced market place creates less time for study and more need for quick, practical solutions).  I think sometimes that the London risk team conveys a feeling of superiority over their Houston counterparts with regard to their risk analysis skill set, their \"theorectical\" approach.  And sometimes the Houston team just wants to know why those London guys can't organize their processes, vacation schedules and holiday staffing to get time deadlines met, \"practical\" solutions that the Houston team has down to a science.

There had also been a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day to day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead of verbally and as a result Heather is left out.

If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation.\n\nWhen the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit.\n\nIt would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion."}

I joined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the leap. I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by orders of magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I cannot help but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional success and satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always carry the confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the business.  I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame where it does not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, laying blame may soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are still many at Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energy markets in the United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As I, like many others, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I will leave with mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such an awesome organism like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and thoughts are with you as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses, and again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of Enron.

Thus, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for that margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Our swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but in essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margin MSCG.

My understanding is that PGAS was to be simply a vehicle to provide the end user volumes to Gas Logistics, in addition to the TBS volumes, as is current practice. We want to pursue having these volumes supplied to Measurement  via email so that they can be imported electronically. Again, these are not  OMVs in the traditional sense, since custody transfer has occurred on the TBS volumes. There is currently no mechanism in place to compare the TBS volumes to the end user volumes other than manually. Additionally, due to the time of the month that these numbers are received, I'm not sure that there is sufficient time to argue the accuracy of the numbers . Currently, paragraph 4. of the End User agreement states \"The Shipper's transportation agreement will be billed on the actual measured takes at the End User's POI.\" It does not address any differences between the TBS volumes, positive or negative, other than Shipper is responsible for any imbalances resulting from the measured volumes at the End User POI.

It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at Enron. \"When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented,\" says Thuraisingham.   The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases. \"There is a premium in the price for firm delivery,\" says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. \"most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market,\" says Thuraisingham."}

Here is what Ive found out...\n\nNYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up clearing, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past, the first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though the later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse payments have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange is likely to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating the need for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an effort is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above (based on yet to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some degree of transaction data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment performance from NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing payment delays extend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we may see delayed payments from weaker credits in related swap and physical markets.  In this regard, the markets have breathing room since the terrorist attacks didnt occur late in the month.  Finally, there have been general comments from Treasury and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock exchange payments, and the assumption is that the same guarantees would apply to the NY commodity exchanges (but this asumption has not been validated or addressed directly in public comments).

Police had received about 65 reports of a mysterious attacker with a monkey's face and human body scratching and biting victims in and around Delhi since Saturday, a senior police official told Reuters on Tuesday.  Police said they had no clues about the identity of the alleged attacker.  \"Last night (Monday) alone we received 24 calls reporting such attacks,\" Manoj Lal, Deputy Commissioner of Police of Delhi's eastern district, told Reuters. \"Of these, 19 were found to have no basis. The five others had some wounds and we are trying to confirm with doctors how they may have been caused,\" he said.  Television network Star News said people in neighboring Ghaziabad town -- which reported the first attack two weeks ago -- spent the night on the streets armed with sticks waiting for the attacker.  Lal said the entire eastern district police force of about 3,000 personnel had been on patrol since Monday to hunt down the creature.  The Times of India said an industrial worker died on Sunday night in nearby Noida town when he jumped off a first-floor building after being awoken by cries the \"monkey man\" was attacking.  There are a number of monkeys running wild in New Delhi and on the outskirts of the city which sometimes pounce on unsuspecting pedestrians or enter houses.  Copyright 2001 Reuters News Service.

We haven't gotten much communication from \"above\" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.\n\nIf  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.

The biggest \"contributor\" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a. 2nd Order in financial terms).  I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).  Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e. Second Order).  This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.\n\nAnyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).    I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.\n\nI am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.

You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.\n\n2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check)."}

Notional value of $32.68mm executed 5/16/2000 and $350mm on 3/15/2001. I have asked Pushkar to research the cash flows he hedged to determine how those tranche sizes came about.\n\nThe Fair Value of Enron's equity and sub debt (net of the $30mm Merlin piece) per the DASH of December 7, 2000 indicated a value at that time of $360mm. Additionally, the DASH assumed further gain in the base case of approximately $8mm suggesting there might have been $368mm of value to hedge. Because the generic five year Treasury yields also declined from 5.262% on Dec 7 (DASH date) to 4.508% by March 15 (closing/hedging date), the value of the El Paso fixed cash flow stream would have increased in value above $368mm (perhaps to the $380mm range - that's what I've asked Pushkar to check), it would seem to indicate that the original hedges were rolled into the subsequent hedges to represent the value of the entire transaction at final closing. In that case, the original Linden 6 hedges would not be open positions at all but rather a part of the hedging strategy that was required at closing per the executed DASH.\n\nPushkar has indicated he will look into his files to ascertain how the hedges were sized.

Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement."}

If you feel like we should cut down the number of Enron attendees, this is just my two cents worth.\n\nJust for a time frame reference regarding Thomas McAndrews departure date, I took the role over operations in January 1997.  I still owe you the bear in the bicycle story over a beer sometime to give you an idea of the state of the union when I took the role.  We did a lot of upgrading of personnel in 1997, changed our internal definitions of acceptable performance, and created dedicated teams to work on the implementation of Sitara and Unify (in 1998 ad 1999).  We probably weren't doing a great job in operations when Thomas left.\n\nI got with Sheri right after our meeting and gave her slides that I thought would be most effective in the presentation.

As outlined below the client 'Borealis'  wishes to change the terms of the contract given our current situation.  RAC is comfortable with the changes, as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the LPG trader to flatten his book. Further, whilst there maybe the potential of MTM movement between the $180 purchase price from Borealis and the subsequent sale (index related price) back to the counterpart, this will be netted out.  RAC has significant risk appetite for this counterpart, which is a sound credit, rated E5.  The only issue is whether Houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early, which could range between $1,200,000-1,400,000.

For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.

As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.

Initially, I believed that figure to be high.  However, Texas non-farm employment increased 2.3%, year over year (2001 over 2000), for the time period in question.  Since load growth closely follows economic growth, the 3% figure appears to be reasonable.  As we know, the economy is slowing.  One place it shows up is in the non-farm employment data.  Texas non-farm employment in the months of April through July grew 3.2% from 1999 to 2000, compared to 2.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.  For the first seven months of 2001, non-farm employment grew at an annual rate of 1.3%, while in the first seven months of 2000, it grew at a 2.7% annual rate.  This data indicates that ERCOT load growth for the remainder of 2001 will slow from the 3% rate.\n\nTo arrive at an estimate of load growth, I estimated loads using typical ERCOT weather for the periods of April through August 2000 and April through August 2001.

We typically buy power from our services customers at a PX Index price.  Throughout January we entered PX Index based purchases from our services customers into Enpower.  At the same time, Foster was negotiating a certain $150/MWh payment to our customers given all of the noise around the PX, the weird prices that it was printing, and the $150/MWh soft price cap that FERC had in place.  We settled with our customers based on the $150 value.  Most of our customers were fine with this.  To do this we entered annuities into Enpower for the difference between the PX price and the $150 price.  These annuities have been \"hanging out there\" since January.  We should have run those annuities through the books and reserved the amount when we settled with our customers (I am assured by Foster and Postelthwaite that we have properly settled with our customers).

All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade Stubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconciliation.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the \"Customer Touch\" they want to maintain.  I think this approach is delaying our getting control of and resolving the issues that are keeping us from monthly reconciliations and cash to actual liquidations.

Please be advised that this delay could pose a problem at the discharge port as there may be another ship waiting to get in on that date.  The ship scheduled before us (the \"Bachir Chihani\") has slipped to an ETA of June 9 as well, so if that ship arrives before the \"Hoegh Galleon\", we may face delays in getting to the berth.  This could impact our ability to heel out the cargo, which means the economic impact to this delay could be more than just the lost day on the ship.  My current calculation for incentive to heel out the cargo is nearly $140,000.  I have asked CMS about the possibility of bringing the ship in on June 8 after the normal time usually allowed to start inbound (approximately 14:00 to 15:00lt).  I will let you know as soon as I receive a response.  In the meantime, please provide an ETA to Lake Charles using what you consider to be the maximum speed possible for the remainder of the trip.\n\nIt is very disappointing that so much effort would be put into flying a pump from the US to Europe and then so little effort put into trucking the same pump to it's final destination within Europe.  It seems that the least costly part of the trip has ended up costing a day of utilization on the vessel and could have an additional $140,000 impact."}

The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.

The most viable and quickest way to get the cash we felt was to increase the revolver from $35 MM to $70 MM because, as stated below, there exists significant current capital needs to fill the Enron #1 storage cavern.  However, even still, this would only ensure a cash distribution at the end of December - the normal schedule for the partnership.\n\nThere may be one more possiblity.  We could reapproach the board about the prior structure of levering up Bridgeline in order to extract cash from the joint venture - it failed last year because Texaco did not want the cash.  It may different now that Chevron is involved, but I doubt it.  My guess is that senior management (i.e. Louise) would have to put pressure on the appropriate channels.  I would rather pay a \"premium\" to Chevron/Texaco for levering Bridgeline than entering in a series of park-and-lend arrangements because we could get more cash up front. In addition, any park-and-lend arrangements could have negative earnings impacts contingent upon the shape of the NYMEX."}

My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken out of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we should be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragraph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in service within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., continue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and placed into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operating compression in excess of its certificated capacity.

Have we concluded that even if FERC rules in our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enforce our rights under the transporation agreement(s) with SoCalGas?

Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.

There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.\n\nWe asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : \"Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements\".\n\nThe ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!

The below schedule of buy deals have not been paid (i.e. Colonial never actually billed ENA).  Therefore, I can use the payment due on these payables to clear the existing A/R balance.  The remaining $531.09 is inconsequential.\n\nSecond, Colonial gave me erroneous information for Mar-01 recall items.  They originally listed various sale items that were EOL deals, thus indisputable.  We have finally come to agreement that all recalls for Mar-01 should have been booked under ENA sale deal #336733, days 8, 22, and 24-26, a total of 22,500 MMBtu recalled.  Upon research of this new information it has been determined that the entire 22,500 is booked as buy / sell, as expected.  However the purchase side shows that 18,000 MMBtu of these items actually had an ENA purchase price of $0.00000 and 4,500 MMBtu at $5.54000, which was never billed to ENA but was paid.\n\nTherefore, it seems obvious to me that in light of no price or non-billing of these purchases, the real intent was a true recall of our sales with no affect to the purchase side at all.  Furthermore, both the sales and purchase sides of the 22,500 MMBtu for Mar-01 has been \"zeroed\" out, creating a total credit due to Colonial of $103,050.  Please let me know if there are any objections to this.  If so, I will need support from Cindy / Dick for the purchases booked for Mar-01 prod. and their \"0\" prices.

Daniel informed Rick that version 1.43 is corrupt and should not be used.  The software has a bug which can toggle the USER/STANDARD setup values when edits are made to the unit.  On September 19th the calibration standard was changed which requires the new calibration components be entered into the chromatograph.  These edits were made using the version 1.43 of Daniel configuration software.  Due to the problems with the software, some of the components configuration changed from STD to USER.  This change effects the communications between the Fisher ROC and the chromatograph which prevented the ROC from receiving some of the gas quality information.  Based on our research and testing we feel that this problem did not effect the chromatographs internal calculations.\n\nSince the only items effected by this was some of the components and not the BTU or specific gravity, this problem had very little effect on the volume calculations.  For example I changed the methane and Nitrogen values by 1 percent and the calculated volume only changed by 0.07%.

So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.\n\nIt is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while \"opening\" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.\n\nThat said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).

Although we could do little about a suicide attack from the air, there are many other types of attack we could prevent or minimize.  The Houston Police Officers, around the buildings and on regular patrol, provide good basic protection.  However, in the event of a city-wide attack, the Police  would be unavailable and we would have to take some type of action ourselves.  The Security firm contracted for the building lacks the training to respond to life and death situations.  I would recommend, and volunteer for, a security team comprised of Enron employees with prior military or police service.

The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!

Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.\n\nGeir"}

Chris asked for some further data regarding historical NY prices for the March through June period in 2001 and prior years  and for a comparison of the onpeak prices with 7x24 prices.

There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, specifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the issue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility.  Will check on that angle.\n\nIn any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdiction of Barton's subcommittee.  Instead, the tax title would have to go through the Ways and Means Committee.  There were some energy tax provisions in the House-passed energy bill last August.  Chris and I will consult tomorrow to see if this issue was included in that bill.\n\nAside from the tax issue, Barton bill would require the type of interconnection rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local distribution and to transmission).

Gerald Nemec and Mark Knippa both confirmed that Enron did not issue a financial guarantee, even though the project closed prior to the start of operations.  At the time of closing, construction was about 2/3 complete and the legal documents were in place stating a definitive start date.  The definitive start date ensured that funds would flow regardless of whether the facility was operational.  Essentially, TW was on the hook for the annual payment, etc. beginning on the start date outlined in the legal agreement.

As a basic premise of dealing with consultants, one has to understand that they will spend time doing whatever you ask them to do (i.e., prepare a budget for tasks from beginning to an FERC filing or prepare a budget for tasks to take us from beginning to post construction).  Either way, you have to pay for what you ask them to do.  Therefore, you keep the marching orders as simple as possible, taking the process in steps.  In this way you eliminate superfluous tasks that are not essential at the moment.   Sometimes these projects start out like \"gangbusters,\" but for commercial reasons or some other reason, they go away and you could be left paying for a task that basically has no added value.  I have found it best not to go that route.\n\nIn this instant case, I had broken down my instructions to ENSR so as to minimize their expenditures and even though from your perspective \"ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for Sun Devil since day one\", the consultant need only know and respond to the task at hand - which is the way I have handled it.

Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA \"wish list\" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.\n\nAfter further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.\n\nGlen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.

In mid-2000 the agreement was restructured in order to \"clean up\" Catalytica so it could IPO.  At that time, Enron was credited back the $9.9MM from Catalytica and it was decided by Delainey that that amount should be split 2/3-Pastoria and 1/3Catalytica Equity, with the 2/3 going to ENA West Power upon the sale of Pastoria.  Pastoria did not get the full $9.9MM back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings.\n\nAt this time, since there is no funds transfer, I believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the Merchant Portfolio to ENA West Power."}

According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tenso, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell \"excess power\" not consumed (capped at their \"cota\" or \"meta\" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to \"flood\" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.\n\nThis mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers.\n\nIt is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.

You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.\n\n2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.

The 65 bps was comp for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from s&p and moodys. Had we not run into the el paso issues the number would have held. Given that the new structure requires a new market, new rating agency process and new documentation, we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction. An increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market. I still believe a sept 30 closing is unrealistic. If all goes well, I think we can be done by mid oct. To reach a sept 30 closing, I think the only option would be to ask bank of america to underwrite and buy the whole thing. That would likely be an expensive option. We can discuss in much more detail at our 9am mtg tomorrow. I'd be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to sep 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale 2 weeks later (ideally before 3q earnings release). The assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately el paso's credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit. Just my thoughts. Ps: your gift made my day.

There is an unresolved jurisdictional issue that the petitions filed in the Ninth Circuit are incurably premature because they sought review of orders for which the petitioner was also requesting rehearing.  The current status of the CPUC's Ninth Circuit petitions is that the court has not yet dismissed the petitions as premature and FERC must file the record in the Ninth tomorrow, October 26.  At that point, under Section 313 of the Federal Power Act, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals becomes exclusive, and  FERC will not be able to modify the orders under review except by leave of the court.  FERC has filed, and the CPUC is supporting, a motion for an order permitting FERC to keep jurisdiction over its orders so that it can act on the pending rehearing requests.  By all rights, the court should go along with this, but it's gone on this long.  We are not adversely impacted.

Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.

{"id": 1916, "domain": "Enron", "score": "2", "text": "At Friday's NYISO Management Committee meeting, two proposals were approved that will affect next year's rate schedule 1 charges. The first involves the assessment of regulatory fees charged by FERC for its electric industry costs. As you are aware, effective next year, FERC will be changing the way its electric program costs are assessed to market participants. Under the new method, a unit charge will be assessed against public utilities providing transmission service, including ISOs. NYISO estimates an annual assessment of $4-6 million. These fees will start to be recovered through the rate Schedule 1 charge effective January 1, 2002. This should equate to roughly $0.03 per MWH. The second item approved at Friday's meeting concerned the proposed 2002 budget for the NYISO. Total costs will be increasing roughly $12 million, which will raise the schedule 1 charges for running the ISO (currently $0.60 per MWH) by $0.03 to $0.05 per MWH, depending on the size of the proposed contingency fund that may be included by the Board. Offsetting these increases is the elimination of a $0.30 per MWH charge that has been collected during most of 2001 to create a $50 miilion working capital fund. The ISO expects to achieve full funding of this fund by the end of the current year."}

{"id": 1924, "domain": "Enron", "score": "1", "text": "I just spoke with Matthew and he explained that the transaction tax reserve calculation (a summary of which is attached) was prepared (and communicated to the deal group) early last fall.  The calculation indicates that the aggregate transaction tax exposure (including penalties) is $12,940,182.  The initial suggested tax reserve related to this exposure was approximately 1/2 of this amount but, after discussions with Don last week, was increased to 100 percent - thus the increase in tax reserve of approximately $6,000,000.  Thus, as evident, it is not that a calculation was incorrect but that its assessment probability was increased and thus the suggested tax reserve changed.  Matthew was influenced in increasing the applicable level of risk related to the transaction by a desire to more conservatively posture Enron after the completion of the disposition and to insure that subsequent period \"surprises\" did not occur - obviously, to the extent that collective management is of the belief that such a conservative posture is not appropriate then the tax reserve amount may be reduced.  Matthew spoke with Don before the change was proposed and was under the impression that all were comfortable with the change before it was made - ultimately, we will realize the reserved amount in earnings as the risk of the tax planning strategies subsides.  Matthew will be back in the office on May 8 and ready to speak with whomever desires at that time.

Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.

The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.\n\n2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).\n\n3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.

It would appear that the E. globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during the refining process.  While most papermakers generally don't refine hardwoods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingly do use a single refiner for all grades.  This is particularly true of the Italian mills.  Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining required for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opacity, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suited for this type of processing.  Accordingly, the globulus species (which is also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much better under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus.\n\nIn any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.

While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.\n\nAndersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.\n\nNew auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch.

We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the \"high\" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.

I personally think that racism is as much of a crime as anything else. It is mostly our perception of crime and security that influences decisions- The crime situation in Kenya is not directed towards a single race- pretty much every body is affected by it, people of all races and all ages. What happened in Zimbabwe was directed at a particular race, and there is no justification for that regardless of what anyone says, I am not taking sides, but maybe there was a more just way of dealing with any problems that the locals had. The negative attitude comes mainly from tourists and the media all over the world. Tourists come to africa mainly for the wildlife and safaris etc.. Therefore the tourists have to be from a place where these things do not exist. ie: Europe, Asia, North America - \"Most\" Europeans are white, they are the closest continent to africa and obviously most of the tourists come from there.

However, the typical dancer is usually tall and lean, but just because you aren't tall and thin doesn't mean you can't be an amazing dancer. But if you are trying to get in shape to be a great dancer, I would say focus on legs, abs, and shoulders.  Abs are the center of everything. If you don't have killer abs, you don't have much.  Legs are an obvious, and shoulders because while dance instructors watch your feet, most people in the audience will be focused on your arms. Hope that helped!"}

Had something happened in the US, there would have been little attention given on what had happened.  Statistically, Aruba is a very safe place, especially compared to how other countries are.  Visitors need to be held accountable for their actions and realize that you can't do whatever you want when you visit places.  You need to take the same precautions when you travel (meaning no going off with strangers in strange places).  I like Aruba and would never let one rare incident change my decision to visit.  I also think it's wrong that anyone try to influence others too avoid a place over press that they hear on the news.  Media in general tends to be biased in making people believe their side of the story.  Good journalism would accentuate how nice the island is and state how rare kidnappings and violence is, rather than hiding the obvious that the young woman probably had way too much to drink and her friends let her go off on her own."}

When we were dealing solely in macroversal terms, that is events we can see and measure with standard instruments like a yardstick, four dimensions were sufficient, length, width, breadth, and duration.  Time is not a dimension, that's a misconception, time is the tool we use to measure duration, just as we use inches or meters to measure length.  When particle physics and quantum mechanics, not to mention Special and General Relativity, became accepted, it was discovered those were inadequate to explain the Universe as we were beginning to understand it.  One theory is that there are the four we started with, plus 6 dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds located at every point in 3 dimensional space.  Another is that the universe we can physically interact with is only a 3 dimensional brane suspended in a 4 dimensional bulk.   So we have either 7 or 10, depending on which authority you ask.  A third theory is that there are two four dimensional branes separated by a 2 dimensional space, but at least that still only leaves us with 10.

That said, we have to remember that the press is staffed by human beings, who aren't perfect. As such, the public should be more responsible in gathering facts from multiple sources. Fines could be levied for the most serious of breaches, but I think for the most part, media outlets do a good job of policing their own. To Dan Rather's credit, he did say that he did not purposely report bad facts, but failed to follow up on the story to see if it had any creditbility and promptly resigned. I believe that news anchors are pushed to report news as fast as possible because in this world of 24/7 reporting, news has become even more ratings driven and the pressure to get one up on the competition is immense."}

However, as a Christian, I do have a Biblical response to the idea of us worshipping a false god. In the Book of Genesis, the entire first chapter lists all of the things God created and aliens are definitely not a part of the list.  Additionally, in the New Testament in the Book of John, the first two verses of the first chapter explain that before God created anything, there was just God, Jesus, and God's Word (that would later be written through man, but would still be the words of God). So the idea of aliens abducting Mary and impregnating her with Jesus is impossible because 1) aliens were never created, and 2) Jesus was alive before ANYTHING was created. The only way Jesus could have been born as a human on earth was through Divine intervention because only God has the power to execute such supernatural acts as having a virgin give birth to the Messiah.

It’s generally thought that the poem was performed orally by the poet before a “live” audience, and that in this way it eventually passed down to readers and listeners. Another theory is that the poem was recited by memory by a “scop,” a traveling entertainer who went from court to court, singing songs and telling stories, until it was finally written down at the request of a king who wanted to hear it again.\n\nBecause there are three major battle scenes in the poem, some readers believe that Beowulf was composed by three different authors. Other readers claim that the sections that take place in Denmark and the sections that occur after Beowulf returns to Geatland were the work of different authors. The majority of critics agree that because of the unified structure of the poem, with its interweaving of historical information into the flow of the main narrative, the poem was most likely composed by one person."}

It is the exact same thing with your voice.  Even if it was 6 mos. ago, chances are you have continued to sing and talk, yell, etc.  In order for your larynx to heal, you must NOT MAKE NOISE.

I have never needed porn while in a relationship.  When I had urges, she was always there, but that was because we were so open with eachother.

Germany had the best military minds in the world at the start of world war II, with better generals arguably only in the U.S.  Germany was able to take on the world through intensely unorthodox tactics, brave nationalistic soldiers who were excellently trained and armed, and an enemy that was still using policies of appeasement (giving aggressive nations what they want to continue peace).

You do need to consult a lawyer, and you also need to verify the survey, by having a different licensed professional land surveyor check the survey that shows the problem, since that first survey could be incorrect. If it turns out that the garage really is over the property line, you will probably be able to recover damages from the developer. The developer may accept responsibility, or they may seek to recover damages from the surveyor who made the mistake that created the problem, depending upon what happened at the time of construction.\n\nHowever, you do not need to do any of this until your neighbor raises the issue. If your neighbor does not insist that you either tear down the garage, or pay them for occupying a piece of their property, then you do not need to do anything. It is your neighbors responsibility to act to defend their property rights. If they fail to act, you may not have a problem at all, even if the garage is over the line. There are thousands of situations like this all over the country. Land surveyors discover these situations every day. In many cases, the neighbors have simply agreed to accept the situation as it is, especially if they are friends, and the situation has existed for years with no problem. So do not panic, try to get your neighbor to agree to accept the garage location, and if they do, document the agreement for your future protection."}

He confronts the evil / the wickedness, although he's nearly driven mad by the encounter.  So, in one way, it's a story of triumph. (It's the tragic vision of mankind)."}

They also need to be on the lookout for anyone who needs help, because on a mountain there are no giant hospitals, or dogs with hot chocolate in a barrel on their collar to come to the aid of stranded persons.  What about the Good Samaritan?  He helped the man who was near death, saved his life, and wanted no recognition for it.

The animals did not get this. God didn't create 2 males or 2 females, but made them unique and complimentary to each other. It has been shown that men's brains have different properties than women's (less communication between the hemispheres, less development of the language area).

There's also Busch Gardens in Tampa which goes for an African feel similar to Animal Kingdom but not the same scale."}

Your personality is already in place by the time you're 5 years old. It's not only about her liking you. You have to like her. Try to go some place fun for the first date like an amusement park or bowling alley. That way if it doesn't go that well, at least you'll have some fun.

Live by the home time one and make adjustments as nessesary to the local time.  In other words if you normally go to bed at 10p your home time, even if its 7p local, still go to bed then.  This helps keep your body more in sinc.

I don't agree with all the reasons we went to war.  But I am glad for it just for the fact of Saddam being out alone.  Thankful for all those Iraqi people who are out from that fear."}

The winter is dull and sometimes wet and windy, though nothing like in the US. April is a month of change, so it can pour it down and sunshine during the same day. From September the weather grows steadily worse (wetter and colder) up until March. It's dull, overcast, cold/cool during the winter, although really our winters can be either wet and mild, as they have been recently apart from a few weeks of this past winter, or they can be colder and drier. (Think -10C minimum to +8C maximum approx) Summer can get up to +32C to +35C, but may equally well be +24C. Depending on where you are in the country the rainfall can vary dramatically.

But it seems those that were of the deepest hue or most vibrant held a special place. There are not many vibrant purple flowers. They also don't just grow anywhere and most likely had to be cultivated in green houses which obviously would be connected to the royal family. Colours like red were also considered royal. The deeper and more vibrant the more likely a royal family would use them as their emblem and would incorporate the colour into their clothing and servants uniforms etc. The same goes for purple. I also think that purple, because of it's rarity became thought of as a godly colour and therefore it followed that only those who were appointed by god were permitted to adorn themselves with it.

Look at how the myth of FDR's \"New Deal\" has taken hold, people think those programs pulled the country out of the \"Great Depression\", but all it did was boost morale a little. The developing world war and demand for raw materials and armanents is what slowly picked up the U.S economy by late 1936, if you go back and examine contemporary economic data and financial journals. But democrats control the history textbooks, and much of what is taught today is irrelevant crap and it's easy to see how the younger generation is disillusioned with a country whose heritage they learn little about, just the \"pc\" stuff. That is why we are doomed to repeat past mistakes, and after democrats really foul things up, there will be another \"1994\" and maybe this time the republicans will get \"term limits\" into law, so they won't get too complacent and voted out enmasse?

As a young man studying medicine, Guevara traveled \"rough\" throughout Latin America, bringing him into direct contact with the poverty in which many people lived. Through these experiences he became convinced that only revolution could remedy the region's economic inequality, leading him to study Marxism and become involved in Guatemala's social revolution under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.\n\nSometime later, Guevara became a member of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that seized power in Cuba in 1959. After serving in various important posts in the new government and writing a number of articles and books on the theory and practice of guerrilla warfare, Guevara left Cuba in 1965 with the intention of fomenting revolutions first in the Congo-Kinshasa (later named the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and then in Bolivia, where he was captured in a CIA-organized military operation. Guevara died at the hands of the Bolivian Army in La Higuera near Vallegrande on October 9, 1967. Participants in and witnesses to the events of his final hours testify that his captors summarily executed him, perhaps to avoid a public trial followed by imprisonment in Bolivia."}

Paganism can be traced back to Neolithic times and survived up until the middle ages when Christianity became powerful enough to erase it from existence. Paganism is an earth based religion which lays emphasis on the worship of all aspects of nature. Paganism appeared very early on in the history of the world. Examples of early paganism, can be seen in ancient Greek and Roman religions, as well as in ancient  Goddess worship and Druidic religions.\n\nAncient people believed that everything had a spirit and were polytheistic and they placed great importance on the worship of many Gods, Goddesses and Deities. Gods were a part of everyday life and great emphasis was placed on placating them through worship and ritual.

I believe it is time for the american citizen to stand up and take our country back from the politicians and make this country great again. After all, We are 'we the people'. Our government needs to know that they work for us and that 'we the people' will not tolerate being lied to, deceived or tolerate their corruption any longer.

Every man is going to cheat on you if he considers you a mere object - everything then boils down to going down to the grocery store and picking out some new meat to devour.

While our universities are top-notch, our students don't get the math/science drenching from childhood to adulthood they get in Asia.

That was a premise Darwin himself put forth that said that if some system would not work at all if you removed only one part, then evolution is a fallacy.  There are numerous examples that scientists have found.  By scientists, I mean research scientists with far more education that you or I.  Look inside the living cell.  There are countless systems that would simply break down upon removing only one part.  The problem in Darwin's day was that people (including Darwin) thought that the cell was a blob of plasm with a slightly darker center.  I suggest you seriously look into it.  Regarding Creationism specifically, the number one piece of evidence in favor is information.  DNA contains so much information in such highly organized fashion that top statisticians say that pure chance could not account for it even in the billions of years since the earth cooled.

I was told this story by a man with whom I go to church who flew with the RAF bombers and was shot down over Nazi Germany. While in the POW camp the men were fed what was called \"German Black Bread\" which was bread made with flour AND sawdust (because sawdust is a lot cheaper than flour!). When I asked him how he could eat that he simply responded \"you've never been hungry, have you?\". The men dug three tunnels underneath one of their barracks, working for many days and nights with Nazi guards close by. They named the tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry. On the night of the \"escape\" they drew straws to see who would get to go (there were a lot of men!), but the man who told me the story didn't get to go. It was probably for the better, though, as only three men escaped and of those only one made it safely back to Britain.

The fact of the matter is, it WAS some time before the New Testament was put together as one.  What is not disputed, however, is that every book of the New Testament was widely accepted as being Divinely Inspired, and that no books outside of the New Testament were widely accepted as being Divinely Inspired.  A few of the books that we now have in our New Testament was debated by some.  No books outside of our New Testament were argued to be Scripture.  None of the books that were disputed were attacked for their authenticity, by the way, simply whether or not they were indeed \"inspired by God.\"  This dispute was finally settled when they looked through other early church writings and discovered that the earliest mentions of these books all treated them as scripture.  So, every book of the New Testament was immediately recognized as scripture, but it was not until about the middle of the third century (not the 16th) that we find the collection of 27 books we find today.  It should also be reiterated that NO OTHER BOOKS were ever even considered.  The council of Trent, that you mention, is only when the Catholic church made those 27 books \"official,\" because someone realized that the Catholic church had never \"officially\" stated that these 27 books were the New Testament."}

It consists of Pulau Pinang (an island of 108 sq mi/280 sq km), formerly known as Georgetown; and Province Wellesley (292 sq mi/756 sq km), a strip of territory on the Malay Peninsula adjacent to Pulau Pinang. On the island is the capital, the city of Pinang, also known as Georgetown (1991 pop. 219,376); it is Malaysia's second-busiest port. It was founded in 1786 by British merchants and was ruled by Great Britain until it became part of what is now Malaysia in 1957. The island has large tin-smelting works, and large areas are devoted to rice and rubber. Well over half the inhabitants of the state are Chinese. Indians are less numerous; less than a third are Malays. Pinang Island was the first British settlement on the Malay Peninsula. It was occupied in 1786 by Francis Light of the British East India Company with the permission of the sultan of Kedah. After an unsuccessful attempt to retake the island (1791), the sultan agreed on a settlement from the British of an annual stipend, and in 1800 he also ceded Province Wellesley. Pinang, together with Province Wellesley, Malacca, and Singapore, became known as the Straits Settlements. Under the British, Pinang grew rapidly in commercial importance, although it was surpassed by Singapore. Pinang joined the Federation of Malaya (see Malaysia) in 1948."}

We were greeted with a warm welcome by the manager who was all smiles from beginning to end. Our orders were taken promptly and I opted for the chicken and egg donburi (rice bowl). The portion that was put in front of me was quite generous; the chicken was fairly tender and had a strong ginger taste. The rice was quite good and nicely cooked; the egg was mixed in with the chicken and kind of got lost. To be honest I would have preferred a whole fried egg over the bowl (like a Korean bibimbap) but sadly this is not what I got. Overall though this was a pretty good meal for a fast food type place.\n\nThe restaurant itself is new, bright, and very clean. The food came out quickly and as stated earlier the service was top notch, they even split the bills for our fairly large group. Donburi will not be the best restaurant you go to but if you are in Markham and in need of fast food, skip the drive-thru and come here (they are open late)."}

Further, the selection of fillings just isn't adequate when compared with some of the sandwich shops nearby which are also baying for customers.  Chilli, beans, cheese or tuna mayonnaise were some of the only options available and one can't help but question their lack of imagination.  Nonetheless, Potatoland is a great little business which should be worthy of competing with the best in the area."}

This means that any student, faculty member, or anyone with a university ID can get a free ride for one of the hour-long sight-seeing cruises, day or evening.  As a way to get together before classes started, I invited about 10 friends, with only one originally from Pittsburgh, to go on an evening cruise with me.  We had a great time!\n\nThere were only about 4 other people on our cruise so we had full run of the ship, which was pretty neat.  We mostly hung out on the top deck because there was a guide on the top.  The guides on these cruises really know their stuff.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and only knew about 75% of the information provided to us.  Definitely informative and fun!  We loved doing the cruise at night, and we had great views of the Point!\n\nWe had so much fun on this cruise that we are looking at doing one of the Friday dinner cruises.  Some of the cruises are quite pricey and don't look too exciting so be sure to do your research.  Overall, it's a really fun way to spend an evening in Pittsburgh!"}

We started off with some $1 oysters (happy hour special) and some Onion soup. The soup actually used the lion crocks that you see in Paris, and it had just the right amount of wine in the broth. It was among the best we've ever tried. My main course was a bison bourginon. I've never had braised bison, but this dish will make me want to make it at home. The meat was tender and flavorful. The pearl onions were caramelized, yet retained a soft and satisfying crunch. My only concern was that it was undersalted, but this was an easy fix with a twist of the salt grinder. My wife had the chicken, which is a half-bird cooked all-at-once (rather than partially cooked and reheated). It was juicy, well-seasoned, and served with mashed potatoes and a truffle sauce.  We skipped out on dessert because we had our fill.\n\nThe ambiance was perfect, with cafe-style tables outside, a mid-20th century Parisian decor inside, and Yves Montand playing softly over the speakers. Our server was friendly, genuine, and transparent when it came to describing the dishes. She made us feel welcome, comfortable, and appreciated.

It was super thin and disappointing. The Crabcake & BC Shrimp, for $29, included one slightly more than average sized Crabcake with a table spoon of avocado and three tiny baby shrimp. Mostly breadcrumbs, this dish is way overpriced. Their Pork Ribs, while admittedly fall-off-the-bone tender, were lacking in flavor and only included 4 avg sized ribs for $19.

The bread was piping hot and fresh. They included olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but the vinegar to oil ratio was poor. The amount of vinegar was probably 1/20th the amount of oil. So basically i was left dipping already oiled focaccia into more oil. Not cool. I had to pour out most of the oil and add my own balsamic to get the proportion correct. The bread itself was good though.\n\nI ordered the Jambalaya pasta which came with chicken and spicy sausage on fettucine. The pasta had a lot of flavor, but was really really greasy. By the end of the meal I had an entire layer of orange oil at the bottom of the plate. There wasn't that much sausage in the meal so it couldn't have all come from the sausage.

I am always upset when a steak never comes out the way you asked for it to be cooked - why ask for a tempreature then?  I asked for Med-Rare and got Medium but I ate it.  But worse than the temperature was the over-usage of salt.  This steak was over salted which took away from the natural flavors.  The appetizer of New England Crab & Lobster Rolls were good but they were so small that it was more of 2 bites than 2 rolls.  As for the desert - it certainely wasn't what I ordered but since everyone got the same thing, I figured, they ran out of the other option.  But it wasn't anything that one couldn't make at home (bananas, ice cream, chopped nuts and chocolate syrup).\n\nThe decor was very nice and the service by the staff was exceptional.

I could have called customer service but chose to come in to the store to speak with someone face to face. What a waste of time! I had recently upgraded my phone at Costco and had FANTASTIC customer service (highly recommend upgrading your phone there!) The girl helping me rolled her eyes and told me never to upgrade my phone at a non-corporate store- I assume because this taps into corporate store's business. She also was unable to answer ANY of my questions. When I asked if I could speak to someone who was more knowledgeable she got extremely defensive and rude. The least she could have done was grab a manager to reassure me. But she refused. I've been an AT&T customer for 5 years and this girl made me question my choice. Wish I would have got her name but I was so frustrated with the entire experience that I walked out and immediately placed a call to customer service. Waste of time. For better customer service visit Costco, call customer service from the comfort of your home or visit the Tempe Marketplace location."}

But I have to admit I quite like Lulu; all three of the previous complaints are better here than anywhere else. Downstairs from Tigerlily, Lulu looks like a bit of a cubby hole, and when you go inside it still looks small, but it is deceptively spacious. At the back you have the dancefloor, with pointless but quite amusing coloured lights underneath giving it a very Saturday Night Fever feel. The main area has good standing space and a load of sofas for when your heels get a bit too much (I would assume, generally not rocking the heels on nights out). They have a VIP area as well, with its own bar and cool comfy chairs, fitting up to about 50 ish people (the VIP area, not each chair obviously).\n\nDepending on days and times the door prices vary, but it seems to generally be: early about a fiver and later (past 12) a tenner. This may seem steep but there are quite a few guest lists you can get yourself on to save a few pennies and sometimes queue jump. Again depending on the nights the drinks deals vary but you can get spirit and mixers for about £1.50 to £2.50. Just make sure you get the house spirits, sometimes the bar staff are a bit cheeky and try to give you the best vodka etc and charge you loads for it.\n\nOverall it is a good club, probably the best on George Street, and if you like putting on your glad rags and dancing to chart / house / RnB then this is not a bad place to go to."}

It was absolutely top-notch - fresh, all flavors clean and working beautifully together. Next up, Crispy Pig Ear with Frisee, Mushrooms & Poached Egg.

That being said, the layout of the place kinda sucks. It's long and thin and is always super crowded so you can never move around. Additionally they create another line to get to the upstairs area and that takes up even more of the very little room they have. If you do manage to get up there though, it's really nice. They keep the top level from getting as crowded as the lower ones, there's usually a DJ, theres an extra bathroom and the bartender to customer ratio rocks up there.

The soup was nothing special and combined with the noodles, it seemed like something that is served at a Chinese cafe.\n\nOverall, maybe come back and try a donburi with a pork belly snack dish.

Yes, there was a small cadre of violins but no way did the group produce that bigger sound. Cheesy Christmas scenes displayed on a fuzzy screen was - I guess - supposed to distract, and for me, it did as I kept thinking someone might introduce them to a video art app or maybe any computer program. Just outdated. The creator, Chip Davis, addressed the audience from somewhere else reminding us about this updated 2016 version of the show. Really?  If you love Burl Ives as Frosty the Snowman, this is the concert for you! They called it in. The soloist, daughter? (brought to us via that fuzzy screen again) sang from another concert venue, probably in another century too. Maybe she's now a granny. The drummer gave little balance to the rest of the group just banging away as they stood on their \"marks\" never attempting to liven it up with movement. I never thought much of the 70's fashion-wise, and this concert solidified those feelings. Some people did give them a standing ovation but then, they were baby-boomers and I suspect hearing impaired. At $100. a ticket (times two,) this baby-boomer felt robbed."}

The bus boy who refilled water, brought bread and took our plates came around more often than he did.

The servers here are not the greatest, the food mediocre, and for this particular location there is so much seating, and its so open that it almost has a negative effect on the location...It makes it seem as though there isn't many people in the restaurant, and that its not very popular because of all the empty seats, at least that's the way I see it.

We checked in, went up to the room they assigned us, and someone was already in it. Ok... So we go back down, explain to the manager that they gave us a room that was already occupied, and he assigns us a new one. Everything seems to be back on track, until we return from dinner the following night, get up to our room, stick our key in the door, and it doesn't open. Awesome. Again, we have to go all the way back downstairs to speak to another manager. He tells us that \"someone\" had switched us to another room in the system. Obviously without our knowledge. So the manager gives us $100 food and beverage credit for the inconvenience. Nice gesture, but it doesn't really make up for the heart attack I almost had thinking they had given our room away and someone made off with all our belongings.

I asked for volume at the roots and he didn't set the rods on the scalp. They were rolled very loosely off scalp and I know that's how the typical digital perm is set, but I was hoping it would be done with volume. As a former hairstylist I understand the concept of how a perm should be wrapped to achieve that. Also, since the Perm solution was applied almost to the scalp, I was expecting the neutralizer to be applied there as well, but it was not. As for the styling it wasn't done to my liking, but that's no big deal. He's great at doing haircuts, though I'm not too sure how comfortable he is with doing perms and styling of the perm. It turned out fine and my hair is very healthy. I'm not sure I would sit for 5 hours again though. There are definitely faster ways to do a digital perm and have it turn out the same healthy way.

I complained to house keeping who stated they would have engineering spray the room. When we returned I didn't smell the spray but I assumed they had done the job. My wife saw small bugs walking around in the bathroom. The second night the biggest bite happened on my arm. That was it. I complained to management and they moved us to a larger \"honeymoon suite\". Management had this nonchalant attitude, just said \"sorry about what happened\" and that she'll upgrade our room for our last night. Will update this later after seeing that \"upgrade\".\n\nHere's the update. First, the manager actually tried to give us another night free in the same room with the bugs, showing she did not listen to our complaint initially. Secondly, stated that there wasn't any room available for another hour. At this time we already waited 2 hours beyond the time she promised earlier, ruined our plans for the day.\n\nWhen i asked for my money back, a room magically became available. The room larger but it wasn't impressive.\n\nLong story short, there are 2 major issues cleanliness and customer service. Splurge a bit and find another place.

After calling in the early afternoon to make a group reservation, I found out later that they are usually closed Sunday nights but the owner, Danny, was nice enough to stay open to accommodate our group. What followed was an impromptu sake tasting, stellar service, and some excellent dishes.\n\nPlenty of good appetizers can be found on their menu like the creamy and rich Chawan mushi (egg custard with shrimp, chicken, and mushrooms), the well balanced Nasu dengaku (sweet miso glazed eggplant), or the crispy chicken karaage. But my favorite app was the salmon oshi sushi -- excellent, well seasoned rice topped with salmon and ikura.\n\nFor an entree, I went with the pork ginger don. Slice of pork with a prominent ginger flavor topped a massive amount of rice.\n\nIf you still have room for dessert, try the An'mitsu. The description of \"agar jelly, fruit, kinako ice cream and brown sugar syrup\" may not excite many, but it turned out to be an excellent dish, kind of like a more refined Halo Halo, where the ingredients are more cohesive."}

In two days the system was installed. The entire unit inside and out was $3000 to $5000 less than any other system quoted.  We also received a manufactures 10 year warranty including parts and labor. The Total cost was $5300.00.  It works great.  Thanks Dave Wrich and his wonderful staff!"}

Although we were the only people in the restaurant, the staff forgot to bring out parts of our order (such as the tea my partner ordered). Still they were friendly. I found their twist on the pani puris to be a little odd. The appetizer comes with three shots of different types of juice (\"pani') that you pour into the puris. The serve yourself wasn't odd as much as the flavouring of the juice.\n\nThe mains are significant in portion. I've never had white butter chicken before, but I found it to be underwhelming in taste. A super filling, but mediocre dish. My partner had the Meat Thali. He seemed to enjoy most of the dishes on his thali. Overall, this place felt more gimmicky than authentic.

Those three are my favorite go tos, I especially love the green olive, golden raisin and egg in the El Capitan. If I have room dessert the fig, cheese and caramel is to die for. The sweetness of the figs and warm caramel is balanced out by the mild saltiness of melty cheese; throw some powder sugar on top and it is awesome.

Yes, it's on a street corner in the parking lot of a tire shop -- BUT it has an \"A\" rating from the heath inspector (most mobile kitchens are \"B\"s at best). Yes, it's in a ghetto part of town, but it's 30 seconds off the freeway, so suck it up, jump off the 96 and risk your personal safety for 5 minutes while you pick up some of the best tacos in Vegas.\n\nThe carne asada is worth the risk and the al Pastor will make you completely forget that you are surrounded by drunken creepers staggering home from Fremont Street.\n\nDelicious!"}

My body is still in awe. My husband had Nia and she was able to relieve an old shoulder injury.\n\nThe massage rooms were nice but a bit small. The music was very relaxing. And the oils used had a very nice scent and were very moisturizing as well.\n\nHere are the bad parts. The front desk staff are quite snobby. It's very obvious they are not people persons. They could at least paste on a fake smile while greeting clients. They did nothing at all to try to make us feel welcomed or appreciated.

The biggest disappointment was the pasta! A kid could make it better, to be honest.  It was beyond bland, lacked any flavor and not even served hot.  Olive Garden serves better pasta and you can buy a grocery store pasta sauce that is much, much more flavorful.  This came as a shock as this is the Giada's restaurant!\n\n2. Service: Incredibly slow.  We waited over ONE HOUR for our entrees to be served! No waiter came to give us any updates. Once they did arrive, a few dishes were not even warm.  We ordered 2 cocktails which took so long to serve that we finished eating our meal in that time. After no word from them about our drinks, we inquired about them only for the to remember. We proceeded to tell them to just cancel it because we were already ready to pay our bill and leave.  After he acknowledged that, a few min later, someone came running with our drinks...probably so they could still charge us for them.  But we again told them no, we already cancelled them because we are done eating now.\n\nOverall, very disappointing experience.  If you want good Italian food, do not come here.  However, if you want average/below average but to be in a place with beautiful ambiance and views, then come and enjoy your time here."}

It was marinated well - not too salty as I find with most marinades.  It hit the spot and definitely tided me over until my next food spot.

{"id": 45, "score": "3", "text": "A few of the responses above has the correct answer. Hopefully the girl you like isn't shy, so try to make eye contact with her. This is often the single most important factor in knowing if you have half a decent chance with asking a woman out. If she does look back at you, try to maintain a few seconds of eye contact before casually gazing away and then approaching her. When you finally do approach her, be friendly and smile. Of course, say hi and introduce yourself. Discuss things that you both can relate to. Ask her questions about herself to show your interest in her and try to lead the conversation but let her do most of the talking. If you can get a woman to feel comfortable with talking to you, your chances of asking her to get some coffee later will likely increase. The rest is up to you.

We have material wealth exported from the Chinese industrial sector; they would be holding worthless bonds.  The downside in the crash of the bond market here is that we would no longer be able to borrow to cover our debt; but then, neither would they, since so much of the value of their national wealth is based in holding US bonds that would become worthless overnight.  Hence, no one would want to lend to China, because China would suddenly become insolvent (not that they need to borrow today, but in a Cold War scenario, they's lose the US as their biggest market and no longer have the ability to remain solvent without borrowing most likely).  Their financing our debt is precisely why China will not want to see it come to a Cold War.  And as for a bona fide war, they boast superior numbers, but we still have a more powerful and sophisticated military with no one else even on the horizon to eclipse us.\n\nMy answer is that it is only in the unforseeable future.  I don't think there's some timeline after which we'll run out of gas.  Any major problem in the US that would challenge our global hegemony would have to be very isolated, like a natural disaster that crippled a region--say, a massive drought in California, a major disaster in the NY area, an epidemic disease, or most likely, some combination of such events straining our ability to withstand it.

{"id": 125, "score": "3", "text": "Liberalism is an ideology, philosophy, and political tradition that holds liberty as the primary political value.[1] Broadly speaking, liberalism seeks a society characterized by freedom of thought for individuals, limitations on power, especially of government and religion, the rule of law, the free exchange of ideas, a market economy that supports relatively free private enterprise, and a transparent system of government in which the rights of minorities are guaranteed. In modern society, liberals favour a liberal democracy with open and fair elections, where all citizens have equal rights by law and an equal opportunity to succeed[2]. Liberalism rejected many foundational assumptions which dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, and established religion. Fundamental human rights that all liberals support include the right to life, liberty, and property. In many countries, \"modern\" liberalism differs from classical liberalism by asserting that government provision of some minimal level of material well-being takes priority over freedom from taxation. Liberalism has its roots in the Western Enlightenment, but the term now encompasses a diversity of political thought, with adherents spanning a large part of the political spectrum, from left to right. In the context of economics, the term \"liberalism\" refers to economic liberalism, which is associated with the political ideology of liberalism itself."}

It I were President, I would have pulled the military out after we crushed their military and especially after we realised that maybe they don't have WMD's.  At first I was pro-let's get them first.  But now I think that it would be best to bring our people home and leave other countries alone unless they attack us or if we have clear evidence that they are about to attack us.  So the difference before and after is that a lot of Americans were ready for a war and now we aren't."}

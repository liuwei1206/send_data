I personally think that racism is as much of a crime as anything else. It is mostly our perception of crime and security that influences decisions- The crime situation in Kenya is not directed towards a single race- pretty much every body is affected by it, people of all races and all ages. What happened in Zimbabwe was directed at a particular race, and there is no justification for that regardless of what anyone says, I am not taking sides, but maybe there was a more just way of dealing with any problems that the locals had. The negative attitude comes mainly from tourists and the media all over the world. Tourists come to africa mainly for the wildlife and safaris etc.. Therefore the tourists have to be from a place where these things do not exist. ie: Europe, Asia, North America - \"Most\" Europeans are white, they are the closest continent to africa and obviously most of the tourists come from there.

When you examine the scientific evidence(yes, science does back up the Bible) you will find that the story of evolution is a weak one.From the evidence of how the earth was formed and how we were created from the dust, you will find that indeed we do have a maker. We must all stand before the throne and give an account to Him one day.Better make sure you are right before you dismiss His existance."}

Had something happened in the US, there would have been little attention given on what had happened.  Statistically, Aruba is a very safe place, especially compared to how other countries are.  Visitors need to be held accountable for their actions and realize that you can't do whatever you want when you visit places.  You need to take the same precautions when you travel (meaning no going off with strangers in strange places).  I like Aruba and would never let one rare incident change my decision to visit.  I also think it's wrong that anyone try to influence others too avoid a place over press that they hear on the news.  Media in general tends to be biased in making people believe their side of the story.  Good journalism would accentuate how nice the island is and state how rare kidnappings and violence is, rather than hiding the obvious that the young woman probably had way too much to drink and her friends let her go off on her own."}

When we were dealing solely in macroversal terms, that is events we can see and measure with standard instruments like a yardstick, four dimensions were sufficient, length, width, breadth, and duration.  Time is not a dimension, that's a misconception, time is the tool we use to measure duration, just as we use inches or meters to measure length.  When particle physics and quantum mechanics, not to mention Special and General Relativity, became accepted, it was discovered those were inadequate to explain the Universe as we were beginning to understand it.  One theory is that there are the four we started with, plus 6 dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds located at every point in 3 dimensional space.  Another is that the universe we can physically interact with is only a 3 dimensional brane suspended in a 4 dimensional bulk.   So we have either 7 or 10, depending on which authority you ask.  A third theory is that there are two four dimensional branes separated by a 2 dimensional space, but at least that still only leaves us with 10.

If you want to know what is the most under reported story of the year, it is the fact that most news is censored and slanted in a specific direction, and this makes it extremely difficult to find REAL truth in the news. So why does the public look to the news for truth (because you most certainly won't find it there)? So much of the truth is left out of the information which is broad casted to the public, and therefore the public is never really 'in the know' about the real happenings of the world. Seek truth, go outside the United States press and read what other countries are focusing on, and see what they are saying about happenings within the United States. Never take the media as being anything more than a biased opinion and a partial truth. Look at the media as a business, and that the bottom line in business is $$$, and therefore they tell us what sells, keep us blind to the true happenings of the world, and keep us thinking that we are educated in the news of the world.Take all the news you read and hear with a grain of salt, and know that there is more to it that what is being told. Be objective, is my advice!"}

However, as a Christian, I do have a Biblical response to the idea of us worshipping a false god. In the Book of Genesis, the entire first chapter lists all of the things God created and aliens are definitely not a part of the list.  Additionally, in the New Testament in the Book of John, the first two verses of the first chapter explain that before God created anything, there was just God, Jesus, and God's Word (that would later be written through man, but would still be the words of God). So the idea of aliens abducting Mary and impregnating her with Jesus is impossible because 1) aliens were never created, and 2) Jesus was alive before ANYTHING was created. The only way Jesus could have been born as a human on earth was through Divine intervention because only God has the power to execute such supernatural acts as having a virgin give birth to the Messiah.

I do know that many men killed woman and children in the Vietnam war and it has left really bad scares on them along with deep mental problems.

The most important thing to go by is your conscience. You know if you're killing for pleasure or survival except in extreme cases like in Vietnam.

It’s generally thought that the poem was performed orally by the poet before a “live” audience, and that in this way it eventually passed down to readers and listeners. Another theory is that the poem was recited by memory by a “scop,” a traveling entertainer who went from court to court, singing songs and telling stories, until it was finally written down at the request of a king who wanted to hear it again.\n\nBecause there are three major battle scenes in the poem, some readers believe that Beowulf was composed by three different authors. Other readers claim that the sections that take place in Denmark and the sections that occur after Beowulf returns to Geatland were the work of different authors. The majority of critics agree that because of the unified structure of the poem, with its interweaving of historical information into the flow of the main narrative, the poem was most likely composed by one person."}

When Israel was attacked by Egypt and Syria in 1973, the US held back support.  This had the effect of saving Egypt's army and led to a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.  America's continuing limited support precludes a military solution by either side and thus makes a just peace by diplomatic means possible."}

Inside of there, you strained the folds (like muscles) by overusing them by either coughing because of a sickness, or yelling, screaming, talking too loud, or too low or too high without support.  That's another topic (hee hee).  So like when you pull a muscle from exercising too much on a leg muscle, for instance, it takes a while for that muscle to return to normal: it hurts, stings, strains, it's weaker.  It is the exact same thing with your voice.  Even if it was 6 mos. ago, chances are you have continued to sing and talk, yell, etc.  In order for your larynx to heal, you must NOT MAKE NOISE.  I know, easier said than done but PLEASE do yourself a favor and rest it. That is what this vocal doctor orders.  Mouth everything that you can, cancel singing engagements, whatever it takes; you must take care of your 1st soprano sweetness for choir - even if it means sitting out a performance or giving away a solo.

The germans used Blitzkrieg war, which totally caught the world by suprise, waiting for another trench war.  The Polish army was actually quite large compared to the german army, but the Germans used a combination of quick thrusting tanks, divebombers, mobile infantry and paratroopers to completely surround and demoralize the enemy.  The German military staff, before Hitler's wonderful purges which slaughtered many genius strategists who were though to be unloyal, was amazing.  Germany had the best military minds in the world at the start of world war II, with better generals arguably only in the U.S.  Germany was able to take on the world through intensely unorthodox tactics, brave nationalistic soldiers who were excellently trained and armed, and an enemy that was still using policies of appeasement (giving aggressive nations what they want to continue peace).  Germany caught the world of guard, and if Hitler hadn't betrayed his Soviet friends, than it is arguable that Hitler might still not have lost to the Americans and British forces in the west."}

{"id": 346, "score": "3", "text": "Good answer by Rosemary. You do need to consult a lawyer, and you also need to verify the survey, by having a different licensed professional land surveyor check the survey that shows the problem, since that first survey could be incorrect. If it turns out that the garage really is over the property line, you will probably be able to recover damages from the developer. The developer may accept responsibility, or they may seek to recover damages from the surveyor who made the mistake that created the problem, depending upon what happened at the time of construction.\n\nHowever, you do not need to do any of this until your neighbor raises the issue. If your neighbor does not insist that you either tear down the garage, or pay them for occupying a piece of their property, then you do not need to do anything. It is your neighbors responsibility to act to defend their property rights. If they fail to act, you may not have a problem at all, even if the garage is over the line. There are thousands of situations like this all over the country. Land surveyors discover these situations every day. In many cases, the neighbors have simply agreed to accept the situation as it is, especially if they are friends, and the situation has existed for years with no problem. So do not panic, try to get your neighbor to agree to accept the garage location, and if they do, document the agreement for your future protection."}

As hard as it will be, try to put their judgements to the back of your mind and fight back by concentrating on your schoolwork and setting realistic goals for yourself. If you do this you will reach them one at a time. Each goal reached is an achievement and will assist in re establishing some belief in yourself. Kelly you must believe in yourself.

On the international relations front there was the denial of airspace issues in regard to our attacks on the country of Libya on April 15, 1986. Americans felt sold out by the French who we perceived as caving in to the Muslim minority in the country. Then of course, the Iraq war. France moved from passive resistance to active opposer to the USA's efforts within Iraq. Of course France with its long history of colonial activity is certainly not one to talk. Aside from that in my view the French are a great culture with a great history, a great language (which is so pleasant to hear), very forward views on human relations.

I also believe that most of the homeless and less fortunate desperately need a friend. Someone to be there for them and to convince them that just because they lost it all doesn't mean they can't be happy again.

Whether she knew of the plot beforehand is still not certain. Hundreds of Protestants were ambushed during church services all across France on the same Sunday. If I remember rightly, no one was punished. Neither side was strong enough to completely suppress the other (which is why the struggle was so long) until Henri IV became Catholic.

Humans are different than the animals. Animals were simply spoken into existence in the creation story. Man, on the other hand, was formed out of the dirt, then God breathed into them a spirit. The animals did not get this. God didn't create 2 males or 2 females, but made them unique and complimentary to each other. It has been shown that men's brains have different properties than women's (less communication between the hemispheres, less development of the language area). That doesn't make them inferior, just different. Men focus better on 1 task, where women are cooking supper, corralling the kids, and thinking about what needs to be done for the upcoming vacation--they can do that with their abilities. Men have the current time in view, women plan ahead more (at least in my family). That gives a different perspective on life. I hope that is a non-flippant answer for you."}

True love is when two people respect and have high expectations of each other and for each other. Not wanting to harm  or manipulate each other. One not wanting to coerce the other into doing things that they don't want to do, or are not ready for. When someone is always kind and concerned about you, and your concerns. Someone who wants to help you reach your goals; and gives you their undivided attention. When your love doesn't fade but grows stronger, no matter how much adversity comes, that not even illness will turn them away. I think that's the type of love everyone searches for, but is afraid to expect and we end up settling for much less."}

Even if we were to put our physical body aside and not think of ourself there will still be that intelligence which is. Such intelligence can never die or end. Only the image or concept of life has beginning and ending and so death appears real to the personality, who is living the image. But see (live) through the personality and our center of awareness is the nonpersonality (everywhere and nowhere), the nonliteral perspective (God). This may also be called living life or the resurrection of life, as life (whole being) is before experiencing."}

As a young man studying medicine, Guevara traveled \"rough\" throughout Latin America, bringing him into direct contact with the poverty in which many people lived. Through these experiences he became convinced that only revolution could remedy the region's economic inequality, leading him to study Marxism and become involved in Guatemala's social revolution under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.\n\nSometime later, Guevara became a member of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that seized power in Cuba in 1959. After serving in various important posts in the new government and writing a number of articles and books on the theory and practice of guerrilla warfare, Guevara left Cuba in 1965 with the intention of fomenting revolutions first in the Congo-Kinshasa (later named the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and then in Bolivia, where he was captured in a CIA-organized military operation.

Residents get all the protections and freedoms protected by the Constitution.  In fact, they would be almost like citizens are now.  The new Citizen would be a person who had served the Constitution with a willingness to sacrifice for the good of the country, i.e. police, military, or firefighting.  That shows real civic responsibility.  As a reward for that sacrifice, the new Citizen would then be granted the right to vote and hold office.  None but veterans could do this.

A few of the books that we now have in our New Testament was debated by some.  No books outside of our New Testament were argued to be Scripture.  None of the books that were disputed were attacked for their authenticity, by the way, simply whether or not they were indeed \"inspired by God.\"  This dispute was finally settled when they looked through other early church writings and discovered that the earliest mentions of these books all treated them as scripture.  So, every book of the New Testament was immediately recognized as scripture, but it was not until about the middle of the third century (not the 16th) that we find the collection of 27 books we find today.  It should also be reiterated that NO OTHER BOOKS were ever even considered.

It was occupied in 1786 by Francis Light of the British East India Company with the permission of the sultan of Kedah. After an unsuccessful attempt to retake the island (1791), the sultan agreed on a settlement from the British of an annual stipend, and in 1800 he also ceded Province Wellesley.

{"id": 903, "score": "1", "text": "In my opinion, Mormons aren't any different from any other religion. I have done a little studying of religions throughout history, and have noticed the evolution throughout the years.  Originallly, humans worshipped many nature gods. this is called polytheism, the Jewish people were the first (i believe) to worship a single god (monotheism)but they started out as a polytheistic people. In my opinion (not fact) I believe that religion was originally created as a  means for man to understand his world, and it has branched into many different religions and beliefs. In the modern sense of the word and idea, when you think of it, all religions began as cults. Are they wrong? Not necessarily. But most people don't accept that possiblity. All religions require faith, because there\n\nis no way to prove or disprove their beliefs. I don't judge any one based on their religious beliefs, because I don't know why they believe what they believe, and from a personal standpoint i don't care. However as an observation in society, it's very interesting. Watch South Park episode 712 All abou Mormons, they give a wise and unique look at religion. Hilarious too.  Any way, artists create images of what they think is true. Most people are against mormons, therefore most artists don't like mormons.  Everyone has an agenda, even artists."}

There are even Chinese Jews- ETHNIC Chinese Jews- in Tibet, and they look Chinese.\n\nFor some reason, a lot of people throughout history don't like Jews- the Roman Catholic Church (the one from the Middle Ages, not the Church today), most Arabic nations, Nazi Germany... the list goes on and on. So the distinction, I suppose, is because of their religion and way of life, and also because of certain physical features, like a prominent nose."}

They had a whole life ahead of them. And it was ripped away by 9/11. I can still remember turning on the t.v. and watching the news a bout 9/11. I drifted off into a day dream , I could feel their screams, their terror. You can't even imagine what it would be like. People were scared, they were hurt and dieing. After 9/11, I couldn't even imagine the family/friend's loss's. It was definatly bad for them!  They were in pain, tears were rolling down their cheeks as the tried to \"breathe\" it all in. People's lives were destroyed!"}

She is in a special unit where she is with other women that harmed children, so she is safe from the other inmates who would not like her very much.  She can wear her own clothes, wear make up, and basically just hang out and have fun all day. I remember seeing pictures of her, all smiles, with other inmates.

Meanwhile, when the pendulum swings, the next administraton will lower taxes so they will have more business here and therefore more people employed and even more taxes from the businesses pouring into the government to pay  public bills. New Jersey is scary enough without Korean Missiles. Korea and Iran are screwed up countries. N. Korea is poor and screwed up and Iran is rich and screwed up.

If we do not take initiative and act proactively then we are most likely to follow random purposes all around us. In my view life is all about action and the weakest form of action is in thinking. But this weakest part becomes the strongest when we are able to establish a direct correlation between what we think and what we eventually do. This is an ability that sooner or later we all have to develop. The same purpose we have in mind when we chooses mottos in our life – to strengthen our thoughts by setting permanent standards in this other wise tricky areas of lour mind.\n\nMy motto in life, the one relating to yours, is ‘readiness is all’. For there is more reason in preparation than there is in elaborate planning. Planning is indispensable in normal life but it is useful when it is done as a part of preparation of our mind. There is nothing such as perfect planning, but readiness in mind enables us see what we look for. We just have to stay alert and ready in life to deal with its rapid flow, and to pick out just a few moments of opportunity out of many."}
